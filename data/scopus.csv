Due to some external or internal factors, WSN may change dynamically and therefore it requires depreciating dispensable redesign of the network. The traditional WSN approaches have been explicitly programmed which make the networks hard to respond dynamically. To overcome such scenarios, machine learning (ML) techniques can be applied to react accordingly. ML is the process of self-learning from the experiences and acts without human intervention or re-program. The survey of the ML techniques for WSNs is presented in [1], covering period of 2002–2013. In this survey, we present various ML-based algorithms for WSNs with their advantages, drawbacks, and parameters effecting the network lifetime, covering the period from 2014–March 2018. In addition, we also discuss ML algorithms for synchronization, congestion control, mobile sink scheduling and energy harvesting. Finally, we present a statistical analysis of the survey, the reasons for selection of a particular ML techniques to address an issue in WSNs followed by some discussion on the open issues. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Data aggregation; Energy efficiency; Machine learning; Network lifetime; Wireless sensor networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054085311

This torque observer allows to estimate the aerodynamic torque to be used by the controller in order to calculate the value of the optimal reference speed for the wind turbine. The vector control theory is applied in the present approach, and thereby the stator flux-oriented control is used for controlling the speed of the wind turbine generator.

This manuscript discusses the utilization of water produced from geothermal wells for irrigation and industrial purposes. In order to identify the suitability of the water for the above mentioned uses, various hydrochemical parameters were evaluated. Samples were collected from three geothermal well sites from Unai village, a prominent geothermal field situated in Navsari district, Gujarat, India. The hydrochemistry of the samples collected from hot spring (depth 30–45 m) was studied and samples were examined by calculating different parameters. The complete study was done individually for both industrial and irrigational uses of geothermal water. The mean surface temperature of the water is 55 °C and average pH of the sample studied is 8.12. The key Water Quality Indices (WQI) such as Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) and Larson-Skold Index (LS) were examined for industrial utilization and the key indices like Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR), Sodium Percentage (SP), Kelly Ratio (KR) Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC) and Permeability Index (PI) were examined for irrigational utilization of geothermal water. LSI and RSI values show that carbonate and bicarbonate concentration is in the desirable range, however, LS (15.09, 13.54) is very high which indicates higher Cl- content. High value of indices such as SAR, KR, and SP points out the increased concentration of Na+ in the water sample. The results of this study would help the end users to identify the necessary water-treatments before utilizing the water for industrial and irrigation purposes in the study area. © 2018","Geothermal energy; Geothermal water; Industrial; Irrigation; Water Quality Indices",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053822298

Electromagnetic energy harvesters can operate at an optimum load, which provides the maximum power. However, due to the physical constraints of these devices, such as the limited available volume, the throw is also limited and operating at the optimum load is not feasible. By using a constant load, the optimum conditions cannot be achieved and the harvested power therefore can be reduced dramatically. To overcome this issue, the present paper proposes a new strategy, which consists of adjusting the electric load according to the input level at steady state condition. If the electric load, which is assumed to be a pure electrical resistance, is tuned according to the level of the harmonic excitation, then the harvester can always operate at the optimum conditions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the level-dependent load, an energy harvesting device in the form of a pendulum is designed and manufactured, which is comprised of an oscillating beam sprung to the base, and attached to a generator. Across the terminals of the generator, an electric resistance (digital potentiometer) is mounted and the voltage produced is converted by Joule effect into thermal power, which is considered here as the harvested power. Experiments are conducted by exciting the harvester with a harmonic input at resonance via a shaker. A level-dependent load and a constant load are separately tested. The experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations. It is shown that by adjusting the load according to the input level, the harvested power is increased compared to a linear constant load. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy harvesting; Level-dependent; Nonlinear load",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054397310

These methods assume that the behavior of subsystem mode amplitudes mimic that of oscillators, that the modes within a subsystem are uncoupled, and that the coupling between two different subsystems only takes place through the interaction of resonant modes. In the case of more than two subsystems being connected at a junction, however, it becomes difficult to establish a modal interaction scheme for them. In SEA, the problem is avoided by resorting to the travelling wave approach instead of the modal one. Nevertheless, there is a need for other energy-based methods, like SmEdA, to deal with such a situation. In this work it is proposed to extend the displacement-stress dual formulation, originally intended for two subsystems, to the case of multiple flexural waveguides connected at a junction.

However, the complexity of trailing pulses brings challenges for ultrasonic–based nondestructive testing. In this paper, a trailing pulses self-focusing method for damage detection in thick plates is proposed by utilizing physical characters of trailing pulses. Firstly, the characteristics of trailing pulses are analyzed by theoretical derivation. Then, three steps of trailing pulses self-focusing method including correlation filtering, energy envelope screening and defect matching are introduced. After that, the trailing pulses of single defect can be focused and the accurate positions of defects can be obtained as well. Finally, a prospective application of trailing pulses, which uses ultrasound phased array (UPA) for nondestructive testing, is discussed. The experiment is carried out on an aluminum plate with a remarkable thickness, which illustrates the effectiveness of the method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Correlation filtering; Defect matching; Energy envelope; Nondestructive testing; Trailing pulses self-focusing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054424650

In statistical energy analysis (SEA), the modal formulation is replaced by the travelling wave approach to solve the problem. However, this is not a viable option for other energy-based methods, like the statistical modal energy distribution analysis (SmEdA), and a modal coupling scheme is required for them. If there is a strong impedance mismatch between the multiple connected subsystems, the displacement-stress dual formulation offers a proper way to address the situation. Unfortunately, the latter fails if all involved subsystems have similar stiffness. In this work, the feasibility of the Craig-Bampton (CB) method to address such circumstance is explored. It is shown that the original CB technique does not fulfill the modal coupling assumptions of energy-based methods, so it is suggested to reformulate it to partially mitigate the problem.

The Greek region is often overlooked, due to its lower resources, but through proper converter selection energy benefits can be significant. Furthermore, milder resources offer opportunities for capital expenditure reductions, hence reducing cost of device and energy. Scenarios consider technological maturity, legislation, and resource potential to quantify future cumulative installations that can be developed.

Due to the maturity of offshore wind technology and continued growth of both offshore floating wind and wave energy converter (WEC) technology, there is new opportunity to combine wind and wave technologies in the same leased ocean space through co-located array development. Co-location is projected to have synergistic effects that reduce direct and indirect costs for developments, but few of these synergistic effects have been quantified, and many have not been related to cost. Moreover, there is currently no cost model that incorporates these effects. In this study, we address this need by developing a cost model that represents co-located array developments, particularly for floating offshore wind and WEC technologies. We exemplify the use of this cost model through a case study. Results suggest floating wind-wave co-located arrays are advantageous to WEC-only or floating wind-only.

Most critically, their intermittent supply, necessitates flexible dispatchability from other generators in the grid. Currently, few renewable energy technologies offer this dispatchability, with only concentrating solar power (CSP) offering storage. CSP generates electricity from thermal heat, similar to fossil-driven thermal power plants, with the heat-source being inexhaustible concentrated solar irradiance. The thermal process, however, requires cooling, best achieved with a finite resource; water. CSP is ideally suited to areas of high solar irradiation, typically arid and water stressed. The need for water as a source of cooling is often neglected in the planning and development of CSP. This paper identifies water as a constraint to CSP deployment, and explores CSP's potential contribution to generation through the lens of the water-energy nexus. This aids our understanding of how water availability threatens expected CSP production capacity and places natural limits on its sustainable development. For strategic planning of CSP, we therefore propose the inclusion of integrated water resource management in CSP energy infrastructure planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Energy-water nexus; Integrated water resource management; Renewable energy; Sustainable development; Water stress",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053223248

In case of technique effect, the results showed that GDP, urbanization, and trade contributed to reducing carbon emissions only via energy efficiency but not via renewable energy. Therefore, countries should further seek that economic growth would be accompanied by technological development and faster growth of energy efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Ecological kuznets curve; Energy efficiency; FDI; Renewable energy; Trade",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054844948

With the prolonging of milling time, the hydrogen storage capacity has a maximal value, which are 5.949 wt.% and 6.157 wt.% respectively for x = 100 and 200 alloys, while the dehydriding rate always increases.

Additionally, the heat transfer processes that occur in evaporators and preheaters are studied herein, and several heat transfer correlations are tested. The heat transfer model used in evaporators appears to be a key factor for performance predictions and may require further studies. Finally, the validated model is used to assess the technical feasibility of the installation of a solar MED plant in Valparaíso, Chile. The main results are analyzed under variable weather conditions. In addition, the MED plant is evaluated in different Chilean cities, and a linear dependence between fresh water production and solar radiation is established.

The most important challenge in this network is routing data among vehicles. Therefore, there is a need to design efficient routing protocols for unicast, Geocast, multicast and broadcast transmission modes. The multicasting can be used in many application fields such as emergency, police, and firefighting. There is a large body of studies on multicast routing in vehicular networks. However, safety applications in vehicular networks require a special multicast routing protocol that takes into account the deadline and existing bandwidth constraints. On the other hand, there has been a growing tendency towards electric cars in recent years. Therefore, energy consumption is one of major parameters that should be considered in the design of this routing protocol. The goal of this paper is to present a new Energy Efficient Multicast routing protocol based on Software Defined Networks and Fog computing for Vehicular networks called EEMSFV including deadline and bandwidth constraints. Multicast routing with multiple constraints of QoS has been proved to be a NP complete problem. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: vehicles, fog computing, OpenFlow switches and SDN controller. Moreover, a priority based scheduling algorithm and a classification algorithm to schedule the multicast requests based on their application type and deadline constraint after classifying them are proposed. The partitioning concept is used to decrease time complexity and overhead in the SDN controller. From the simulation results, we concluded that EEMSFV is better than MABC and CVLMS in terms of successfully transmitted ratio, average end to end delay, normalized overhead load, multicast energy consumption, packet loss ratio and percentage of critical multicast sessions that meet the deadline. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Deadline; Energy; Fog computing; Multicasting; SDN; Vehicular network",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054866599

As a result, this paper proposes a hierarchical control framework to improve the safety of FIWMD EVs while save the tire slip energy (i.e. reduce the tire wear), which includes a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in the outer layer and a holistic corner controller (HCC) in the inner layer. The LQR can highly improve the lateral stability of the vehicles under extreme conditions by producing an additional yaw moment and a front wheel steering angle. Whereas, the HCC can efficiently distribute the deviation of the longitudinal force and the additional yaw moment by a step-ahead prediction. In this framework, to reduce the tire slip energy, a semi-empirical tire slip energy model is developed and used for tuning the HCC controller. In this way, not only the lateral stability of such EVs can be ensured but also the tire slip energy can be reduced. More importantly, this paper compares the lateral stability and slip energy of the vehicle under lane change condition between four methods – without control, traditional axis distribution, tire workload usage and tire slip energy. The results demonstrate that the proposed controller presents an excellent control capability. In addition, different from the widely used axis load distribution, the longitudinal velocity of the proposed method is more stable. More importantly, the tire slip power and energy are much smaller than others. It achieves 16.62% reduction of the tire slip energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Tire slip energy; Torque distribution; Vehicle stability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053054245

Therefore, this study investigated the potential of replacing the machined SS blades in a small propeller-type turbine with light-weight composite blades injection molded from a fiber reinforced polymer. Using computational fluid dynamics models and finite element analysis, a carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic was selected from three candidate composite materials for its lower density and smaller blade tip displacement. Injection molded blades using this material were then manufactured and tested in a lab-scale turbine performance test loop to compare with the SS blades of the same design. With the same flow rates, the composite turbine blades generated more power but required a slightly higher head (∼0.08 m) than the SS blades. Both the composite and SS blades displayed similar peak turbine efficiencies, demonstrating the viability of the composite material in replacing SS from the perspective of power-generation performance. © 2018","Composite; Hydroelectric turbine; Hydropower; Renewable energy; Ultra low head turbine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054783578

Consumption of 10% (v/v) ethanol by inbred C57BL/6J female mice from 0.5 to 8.5 days post coitum was used to model alcohol exposure during the first 3–4 weeks of gestation in humans, when pregnancy is not typically recognized. At adolescence (postnatal day [P] 28) and adulthood (P64), the brains of male offspring were scanned ex vivo using ultra-high field (16.4 T) magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Energy metabolism and body composition were measured in adulthood by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively. Ethanol exposure had no substantial impact on white matter organization in the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, internal capsule, optic tract, or thalamus. Whole brain volume and the volumes of the neocortex, cerebellum, and caudate putamen were also unaffected. Subtle, but non-significant, effects were observed on the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in adult ethanol-exposed male offspring. Ethanol exposure was additionally associated with a trend toward decreased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and reduced daily energy expenditure, as well as significantly increased adiposity, albeit with normal body weight and food intake, in adult male offspring. In summary, ethanol exposure restricted to early gestation had subtle long-term effects on the structure of specific brain regions in male offspring. The sensitivity of the hippocampus to ethanol-induced damage is reminiscent of that reported by other studies – despite differences in the level, timing, and duration of exposure – and likely contributes to the cognitive impairment that characteristically results from prenatal ethanol exposure. The hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Our finding of altered daily energy expenditure and adiposity in adult ethanol-exposed males is consistent with the idea that central nervous system abnormalities also underpin some of the metabolic phenotypes associated with ethanol exposure in pregnancy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Alcohol; Body composition; Brain structure; Energy metabolism; Prenatal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054590865

The results showed that the layered Ag-Cu-Ag solid solution structure formed in the Al2O3/Nb brazed joints when the composite interlayer was used. Moreover, the thickness of TiO + Ti3Cu3O reaction layers adjacent to the Al2O3 ceramic substrate did not change obviously regardless of the Cu foil thickness. The maximum residual stress in the whole brazed joint always appeared in the Al2O3 ceramic substrate nearby the interlayer, but it was reduced from 384 MPa to 119 MPa when a 150 μm thick Cu foil was added. The variation of calculated residual stresses as a function of Cu foil thickness, which was verified by X-ray measurement, exhibited a consistent with Al2O3 ceramic strain energy. Thus, the calculation of Al2O3 ceramic strain energy could be a good criterion to evaluate the joint shear strength because the fracture occurred in the Al2O3 ceramic. The reduction of detrimental residual stress was primarily attributed to the increased plastic strain energy of Cu interlayer.

In this paper, the stochastic operation scheduling of a MG consisting of non-dispatchable resources including WT and PV and dispatchable resources including Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cell (PAFC), Micro-gas Turbine (MT), and electrical storage as Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is investigated to minimize operation cost and emissions. The problem is solved by combination of Differential Evolutionary (DE) and Modified PSO (MPSO) algorithms considering Incentive-based (IB) Demand Response (DR) program and generation reserve scheduling. A stochastic model is also proposed for energy management in MGs in the grid-connected operating mode by taking into account the uncertainty of WT and PV generations and forecasted electric demands. A scenario tree is used to generate scenarios and then, representative scenarios are selected by a scenario reduction technique based on DE.

Considering different properties of wind and solar PV power generation systems, the discrepancies between dispatch command (market schedule) and actual renewable generation is firstly counterbalanced by adjusting wind power output via temperately storing or releasing kinetic energy of turbine rotors. Only when rotors of wind generator reach their limitations, should solar PVs begin to reduce their generation. The proposed PSC scheme is fully simulated in a microgrid with wind and solar PV, and the simulation results clearly indicate it can be more energy efficient than the traditional dispatch method while fulfilling the dispatch demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Kinetic energy (KE); Photovoltaic (PV); Power sharing control (PSC); Power system dispatch; Wind generator (WG)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053199344

In this paper, we thus investigate a source-destination link with an energy-harvesting full-duplex relay and a jammer (to degrade the eavesdropper channel) in the presence of an eavesdropper. Thus, to exploit energy harvesting and to improve security, we propose a full-duplex jammer (FDJ) protocol and its half-duplex version (HDJ). Two cases for availability of the eavesdropper channel state information (ECSI) are considered: complete ECSI and incomplete ECSI. For both FDJ and HDJ protocols and for complete ECSI, we derive the instantaneous and average secrecy rates and compute optimal time split for energy harvesting. To gain more insights, we consider a practical interference-limited scenario and derive closed-form cumulative distribution function of the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio at the destination and eavesdropper nodes. Comparatively, we show that FDJ improves instantaneous secrecy rate over HDJ. However, the degree of improvement is highly dependent on time split for energy harvesting, amount of self-interference, the channel gains, and locations of the nodes. Our findings reveal that FDJ increases the average secrecy rate 150% over HDJ and 260% over HD relaying without jammer. For incomplete ECSI scenario, we derive asymptotic secrecy outage and show that FDJ performs better for small-to-medium values of source powers; otherwise, HDJ yields a higher gain. © 2018 IEEE.","cooperative jamming; cooperative relaying; energy harvesting; full-duplex (FD); Physical-layer security",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050616933

An industrial-scale wind turbine can be numerically represented using various approaches (from simpler 2D steady flow to complex 3D with moving mesh, with and without the inclusion of hubs) that can alter the results substantially. At the same time, to standardize and test methodologies, the reference industrial-scale NREL 5 MW wind turbine is gaining popularity. The wind energy community will learn through an improved understanding of the aerodynamics of this NREL 5 MW reference mega-watt size wind turbine by taking into consideration the various levels of geometric approximations. Hence, in this work the NREL 5 MW reference wind turbine is used for both: (a) understanding the associated flow-complexities due to various geometric approximation, and (b) comparison and validation of the performance of different numerical approaches for flow-simulation. The various geometric approximations considered here are related to simulating the influence of the shape of turbines structure (blade, an inclusion of hub, tower) and motions of blades. It involves (a) influence of 2D, 2.5D and 3D turbine blade geometry to highlight the impact of section bluntness, (b) influence of steady frozen rotor and rotating rotor simulations and (c) influence of inclusion of hub through a full-scale geometry of the complete reference turbine. Furthermore, the key features of the flow dynamics of a rotor and full machine are identified and parametric studies are conducted to evaluate overall performance prediction under variable Tip Speed Ratios (TSR = 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9) and variable level of geometric and flow modeling approximations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Finite volume method; Multiple reference frame; NREL 5 MW wind turbine; Sliding mesh interface; Wind energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052235769

Comparing the calculated forecasts for the 23 reference systems to their measured power over a period of 2 years, revealed a comparably high accuracy of the forecast. The mean deviation (bias) of the forecast was 1.1% of the nominal power – a relatively low bias indicating low systemic error. The root mean square error (RMSE), lies around 7.4% - a low value for single site forecasts.

Alternative cleaner energy sources have been largely neglected despite their abundance and the likely complementarities between different renewable resources. This limited mix of energy sources has made the system vulnerable to unpredictable and recurrent drought conditions (El Niño) occurring every 4–5 years. In the past, El Niño brought high energy costs and power supply losses. This paper proposes an optimisation model to study the insertion of renewable energy systems (RES) into the Colombian electricity sector. The model considers a cost-based generation competition between conventional technologies (hydro and thermal) and alternative RES (solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind). It aims at minimising system costs, CO2 emissions, and the number of blackout events. The model is solved by following two procedures known as Implicit Stochastic Optimisation (ISO) and Robust Optimisation (RO), and the results indicate that alternative renewables should replace all fossil-fuel-based technologies for economic and environmental reasons. Solar PV seems particularly promising to expand system capacity, as it contributes to both the reduction of the overall system costs and to the ability of the system to cope with extreme dry weather conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Colombian power sector; Implicit stochastic optimisation; Optimal planning; Renewable energies; Robust optimisation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053223949

Specimens were tested for as many as 1,500 loading cycles under each cyclic loading session. From these tests, the following conclusions can be drawn. The peak stress of cyclic loading has a significant effect on the coal specimen's fatigue behavior. When the peak stress of cyclic loading is less than the coal fatigue strength, the coal specimen's deformation stops increasing after a certain number of loading cycles, and the number of acoustic emission (AE) counts is low. When the peak stress of cyclic loading exceeds the coal fatigue strength, the axial, circumferential, and volumetric strains and the energy dissipation exhibit the same progression through three phases: a primary phase, a steady phase, and an acceleration phase. The region division of the three phases of the strain and energy dissipation evolution is coincident. The AE activity also exhibits three phases: an active, a quiet, and a very active phase. In the very active phases, numerous AE signals exist when the stress is at its peak, but no AE signals exist near the stress minima. Coal specimens that are subjected to conventional uniaxial compression tests and specimens that are deformed by cyclic loading tests fail in very different ways. The former specimens fail mainly because of a single inclined shear plane, whereas the latter specimens are reduced to a mound of small fragments. © 2018 by ASTM International.","Acoustic emission; Coal fatigue; Cyclic loading; Deformation; Dissipated energy; Failure mode",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051790355

Both RhB (cationic dye) and IC (anionic dye) could be efficiently removed by SZTO/CN, which also exhibited elevated photocurrent responses. In particular, the efficiencies of IC and RhB removal over a SZTO/CN sample with a CN/(SZTO + CN) mass ratio of 0.8 after 3-h visible-light irradiation equaled 93.1 and 82.2%, respectively, while the respective values for STO were obtained as 9.7 and 21.8%. Dye degradation under UV light irradiation (e.g., within 30 min for IC) was much faster than under visible light irradiation (e.g., within 180 min for IC), and optimal CN/(SZTO + CN) ratios were individually determined for both irradiation types. Notably, the best performing catalyst maintained over 95% of its initial photocatalytic performance after five consecutive IC decomposition runs, and the X-ray diffraction patterns of cycled and non-cycled catalysts indicated that cycling did not induce any notable crystalline structure changes.

The method, named Dynamic-Active Demand Response (DADR), is based on an innovative paradigm of offering multiple electricity service levels and a dynamic-active demand response scheme. It provides the grid operator with the ability to influence consumption patterns in real time, so that responding to renewables intermittency is more effective in terms of reliability, predictability and response time. DADR's performance is evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which assesses the method's intermittency mitigation potential and estimates the expected economic value of implementing it in the Israeli residential sector. Major components of the model are based on a survey, conducted among Israeli households. The survey results indicate that, given a sufficiently attractive economic incentive, participation rates can reach as high as 85–90%. The Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that DADR can make a significant contribution to mitigating renewables intermittency, with energy savings of hundreds to thousands of MWh a day and a positive net economic benefit. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic-active demand response; Mitigating renewables intermittency; Monte Carlo simulation; Smart grid; Variable energy resources",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053436770

The major residential energy consumption in these regions is for cooking and lighting, which is basically covered with traditional biomass and fossil fuels. This situation acts as a development barrier, while implying stress on resources and the environment. Solar home systems (SHS) can play an important role in overcoming this problem. Recent technological advances and cost reductions in lithium-ion batteries favour their use in such application. Domestic electric devices with outstanding energy efficiency are becoming the standard around the globe. This paper focuses on exploiting these innovations to provide a solution for domestic energy poverty in developing regions. The layout of a SHS that integrates a lithium-ion battery-pack and is complemented with LED lamps and an energy efficient multicooker is presented. The paper assesses the SHS in contrast with existing practices under domestic energy poverty, with consideration of the learning curve. It is concluded that the cost of energy of the SHS is slightly cheaper than the business as usual case on the short term, and notably cheaper on the longer run. Furthermore, a financing scheme is proposed to overcome implementation barriers. Government support is considered, and quantified based on the SHS carbon abatement and saved fossil fuel subsidies. A substantial share of the initial investment can be covered under such scheme. This case study allows to draw general conclusions on the potential of SHS as a solution for domestic energy poverty in developing regions, on the financing gaps that hamper implementation and eventually on the required actions to overcome these. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic energy poverty; Financing scheme; Implementation barriers; Lithium-ion battery; Solar home system",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054786140

For this reason, optimal real-time operation of wind integrated power systems in profit based markets considering the effects of probabilistic future variations of wind speed is one of the main concerns of system operators. For this purpose, some solutions such as demand response (DR) programs and energy storage systems (ESS) are widely being used to cover and manage wind generation uncertainty. But some of them such as DR programs can add some extra sources of uncertainty due to unpredictable customer's behavior. To this end, this paper proposes an online model-based predictive control approach for optimal real-time operation of wind integrated power systems including DR and ESS facilities. Discrete-time manner, re-optimization characteristic, and adaptability are the main features of the proposed MPC method which make it well-suited to address high uncertainties regarding wind power generation and customer's behavior. Besides, MPC considers all interactive effects of the control facilities in accordance with the expected wind farm output power in the future prediction horizon to maximize wind power utilization and so enhance social welfare. In addition, the uncertain nature of wind power is modeled using Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For efficiency evaluation of the proposed approach, simulation is implemented in MATLAB software using YALMIP optimization toolbox for the 8-bus test system. Results confirm the acceptable performance of the proposed approach in reducing operation cost through optimal uncertainties management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response (DR); Energy storage system (ESS); Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); Model-based predictive control (MPC); Social welfare",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054174923

As a result, after a large infeed loss, containing the grid frequency and limiting its rate of change (RoCoF) above certain thresholds would be a challenge for the system operator. In particular, large RoCoFs could activate RoCoF-sensitive loss-of-mains (LoM) protections of distributed generators (DGs) and trigger cascading disconnections. In this context, thermostatic loads (TCLs) can be controlled to collectively provide support and contribute to the overall system inertial and frequency response. This paper focuses on the transient response period after a frequency disturbance and the fast protection events occurring in this time frame. In particular, this works evaluates the interplay between the local activation settings of LoM protection of DGs and those used to enable the TCL support. This interaction is analysed through a case study on a 36-bus dynamic equivalent of the GB network which shows how local post-fault frequency dynamics drive the overall system response. Results show that TCLs are able to prevent RoCoF-driven DG tripping and reduce the need to adopt high LoM settings, decreasing the risks of maloperation associated with desensitised protections. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy resources (DER); Inertial response; Power system dynamic performance; RoCoF-sensitive protections; Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054324102

Diesel and BDF were injected into the cylinder using common rail direct injection (CRDI) facility developed. Electronic control unit (ECU) was developed to inject the fuel at any required crank angle (CA) for any magnitude of duration. At 80% load, engine operation was associated with severe knocking without exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), however engine operated well only for EGR percentage about 50% and 54% with diesel and BDFs respectively. Beyond this EGR level, HCCI engine showed misfiring and unstable combustion. At this condition, maximum HFER possible was less than 8% in both diesel and biodiesel HCCI operations and misfiring occurred beyond HFER of 8%.

To better promote the EEP for the Chinese civil building sector, the Chinese government issued the China Act on the Energy Efficiency of Civil Buildings in 2008. This is the first paper to present a review of this act's implementation over the past decade. Based on China Database of Building Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions and official documents, the achievements of this act are assessed by examining a variety of indicators. The success of the act can be attributed to the following factors: 1) a strong and sustained government commitment to top policies of building energy efficiency (BEE); 2) extensive efforts to apply the BEE standards to newly built civil buildings; 3) various incentive schemes involving energy efficiency retrofitting for existing civil buildings; 4) the increasing adoption of renewable energy to the civil building sector and of systems and platforms of energy efficiency supervision to commercial buildings; and 5) the rapid development of green buildings. Nevertheless, the revised act must address several challenges in the upcoming phase. These challenges mainly include the following: 1) the “double-control” strategy for the civil building sector; 2) the substantial development of the EEP in rural China; 3) the further development of green buildings for the low-carbon civil buildings; 4) the improvement of official statistical data systems on energy consumption and carbon emissions for civil buildings; and 5) building industrialization and informatization. It's expected that our efforts as constituting significant guidance for evaluating the EEP in the Chinese civil building sector, and the efforts will also be treated as an example for other developing countries to evaluate and revise their BEE acts. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Act assessment; Building energy efficiency; China Database of Building Energy Consumption and Carbon Emissions; Civil buildings; Energy savings",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053432861

For modeling of sustainable water treatment options, computationally efficient models may be required. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative review of the water management systems and the associated economic, environmental, and performance metrics. The water management systems are represented as a network of sources, users, technologies, recycling options, and quality of water. Special attention is given to desalination systems. The two main technology categories currently used for desalination are thermal (e.g., Multistage Flash “MSF”, Multi-Effect Distillation “MED”, and Mechanical Vapor Compression “MVC”) and membrane (e.g., seawater reverse osmosis “SWRO”, brackish water reverse osmosis “BWRO”). The cost assessment includes a capital cost comparison (for which regression analysis has been used to account for the non-linear nature of the capacity-cost curves), an operating cost comparison, which includes energy requirements, labor costs, chemicals used, maintenance and repair costs, membrane replacement costs and a unit product cost ($/m3) breakdown, which combines the capital and operating costs. Numerous data were collected for the cost of desalination systems. Statistical methods were then used to analyze these collected data to establish deeper understanding of the relationship to capital cost, operating cost, capacity, constraints due to treatment method capabilities, requirements of the users. The paper also briefly discusses other cost considerations such as the water intake and distribution costs. The environmental impacts (concentrate disposal and CO2 footprint) have also been compared for the various technologies considered. Some integration strategies such as use of hybrid systems, cogeneration plants and use of renewable energy have shown reductions in cost associated due to energy consumption and thereby, reducing the unit product cost. Finally, the paper provides a selection guide suitable for various situations with consideration of the different factors affecting cost, environmental impact and energy demands. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Desalination cost; Energy consumption; Environmental impact; Water treatment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054787387

A statistical design for maximum toxicants removal by zeolite was applied before AD process. Zeolite could mitigate the inhibition associated to compounds such as ammonia, N-heterocyclic compounds, etc. in PHWW and thereby shortening the lag phase and increasing methane production by 32–117% compared with that without zeolite adsorption. Zeolite adsorption also increased energy recovery efficiency (up to 70.5%) for this integrated system.

Water, energy and food are closely intertwined, as both water and energy are critical inputs for food production. Increasing pressure from shortages of resources and increasing demand for food reinforce the need for optimal management of the water, energy, and food nexus. Uncertainties caused by natural conditions and human activities complicate the optimal allocation. An integrated model, called AWEFSM, was developed for the sustainable management of limited water-energy-food resource in an agricultural system by incorporating multi-objective programming, nonlinear programming, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers into a general framework. The AWEFSM model is capable of identifying the tradeoffs of water, energy and land resources among various subareas and crops, generating high-profile and environment-friendly strategies and policies, and addressing parameter uncertainties associated with the fluctuations of natural resources and variation of socioeconomic activities. The AWEFSM model was solved, considering nonlinear membership and non-membership functions with both optimistic and pessimistic views of decision makers, and was demonstrated for a real-world case study in northwest China. The interrelationships and trade-offs among system components, including water supply-demand, energy supply-demand, land demand, food production, as well as water and energy footprints, were quantitatively analyzed under different scenarios.

The power consumption, mean velocities, turbulent kinetic energy production (TKE), energy dissipation rate (ε) and trailing vortices induced by new design impellers with grooved walls and 4PBT were evaluated experimentally and modeled by detached eddy simulation (DES) approach, which has not been tested in blade walls with small perturbations.

As a result, 87 representative factors have been identified and classified, with a hierarchy structure established by ISM. Based on the relative importance of given factors, factor hierarchy structure shows that the energy system in the core nexus is the essential system and is critical to promoting the WEF-nexus in Beijing; factors from peripheral nexuses – such as population and vehicle volume – also have a significant influence on nexus governance. Furthermore, integrated policies from subsystems within the core nexus or between the core and peripheral nexuses are critical to secure WEF in Beijing.

When considering the feasibility of urban agriculture and planning for the future of food production and energy, it is important to understand the relationships between energy flows throughout the system, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and make suggestions to optimize the system. To address this need, we analyzed the energy flows for growing tomatoes at a rooftop greenhouse (RTG). We used life cycle assessment (LCA) to identify the flows within the supply chain. We further analyzed these flows using ecological network analysis (ENA), which allowed a comparison of the industrial system to natural systems. Going beyond LCA, ENA also allowed us to focus more on the relationships between components. Similar to existing ENA studies on urban metabolism, our results showed that the RTG does not mimic the perfect pyramidal structure found in natural ecosystems due to the system's dependency on fossil fuels throughout the supply chain and each industry's significant impact on wasted energy. However, it was discovered that the RTG has strong foundational relationships in its industries, demonstrating overall positive utility; this foundation can be improved by using more renewable energy and increasing the recycling rates throughout the supply chain, which will in turn improve the hierarchy of energy flows and overall energy consumption performance of the system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Food security; Food-energy nexus; Life cycle assessment; Urban agriculture",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053935891

The spatially explicit study combines a life cycle analysis (LCA) for biodiversity impact assessment with a global high resolution economic land use model. Both impacts of domestic land use and impacts through imports were included for estimating the biodiversity footprint of the member states of the (EU28). The analyzed scenarios assumed similar biomass demand until 2020 but differed thereafter, from keeping the growth of demand for bioenergy constant (CONST), to a strong increase of bioenergy in line with the EU target of decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050 (EMIRED) and with the baseline (BASE) scenario falling between the other two. As a general trend, the increasing demand for biomass was found to have substantial impact on biodiversity in all scenarios, while the differences between the scenarios were found to be modest. The share caused by imports was 15% of the overall biodiversity impacts detected in this study in the year 2000, and progressively increased to 24% to 26% in 2050, depending on the scenario. The most prominent future change in domestic land use in all scenarios was the expansion of perennial cultivations for energy. In the EMIRED scenario, there is a larger expansion of perennial cultivations and a smaller expansion of cropland in the EU than in the other two scenarios. As the biodiversity damage is smaller for land used for perennial cultivations than for cropland, this development decreases the internal biodiversity damage per unit of land. At the same time, however, the EMIRED scenario also features the largest outsourcing of damage, due to increased import of cropland products from outside the EU for satisfying the EU food demand. These two opposite effects even out each other, resulting in the total biodiversity damage for the EMIRED scenario being only slightly higher than the other two scenarios. The results of this study indicate that increasing cultivation of perennials for bioenergy and the consequent decrease in the availability of cropland for food production in the EU may lead to outsourcing of agricultural products supply to other regions. This development is associated with a leakage of biodiversity damages to species-rich and vulnerable regions outside the EU. In the case of a future increase in bioenergy demand, the combination of biomass supply from sustainable forest management in the EU, combined with imported wood pellets and cultivation of perennial energy crops, appears to be less detrimental to biodiversity than expansion of energy crops in the EU. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity damage; Bioenergy; EU footprint; Forestry; Land use; Perennial energy crops; Trade",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053935941

Although this conversion improves product quality and quantity, it requires a larger amount of energy input. The new contributions in this paper are, first, an analysis of the energy and environmental performance of two commercial-scale high peak-power hybrid photovoltaic irrigation systems (HPVIS) installed at intensive and super-intensive Mediterranean olive orchards; second, an analysis of PV hybrid solutions, comparing PV hybridization with the electric power grid and with diesel generators; and finally, a comparison of the environmental benefits of HPVIS with conventional power sources. Energy and environmental performances were assessed through energy and carbon payback times (EPBT and CPBT). The results show EPBT of 1.98 and 4.58 years and CPBT of 1.86 and 9.16 years for HPVIS in Morocco and Portugal, respectively. Moreover, the HPVIS were able to achieve low emission rates, corresponding to 48 and 103 g CO2e per kWh generated. The EPBT and CPBT obtained in this study were directly linked with the irrigation schedules of the olive orchards; therefore, weather conditions and irrigation management may modify the energy and environmental performances of HPVIS. The consumption of grid electricity and diesel fuel, before and after the implementation of HPVIS, was also analyzed. The results obtained show fossil energy savings of 67% for the Moroccan farm and 41% for the Portuguese installation. These savings suggest that the energy produced by HPVIS in olive orchards will avoid the emissions of a large amount of greenhouse gas and the exploitation of natural resources associated with fossil fuel production. © 2018 The Authors","Climate change; Electricity and diesel fuel; GHG agriculture; LCA; PV water pumping; Solar energy",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054792448

This is a new analytical method to investigate the effect of shear deformation, and the analytical technique can more accurately evaluate the effect of shear deformation compared with those using the frequency ratio. The coupled axial-bending vibrations are considered, and the material properties of the structure are continuously varied according to power law distribution along the height of the cross section. Under these assumptions, the contribution rates of the related strain energies are predicted from the relationship between the maximum strain and kinetic energies. The shape function of the displacement required in the computation of the contribution rate is deduced by an exact transfer matrix method, and the developed method is used to obtain the exact eigenpairs and shape functions. The effect of shear deformation is examined for various boundary conditions, length-to-height ratios, and variations in the power law index. Therefore, the length-to-height ratios capable of ignoring these shear effects are analyzed for the first four bending-dominated frequencies of the functionally graded beams. The accuracy of the developed transfer matrix method is demonstrated via comparison with the results discussed in previous works; further, we successfully calculated the contribution rate. In addition, the axial-bending displacements coupled by the use of functionally graded materials are investigated to ascertain the reason for the decoupling phenomenon in homogeneous beams. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Contribution rate; FSDBT; Functionally graded beam; Strain energy; Transfer matrix method",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054176763

To remedy this key issue, a piezoelectric energy harvester with stoppers (PEHS) has been proposed by the authors. The stoppers and the magnetically attractive coupling employed in the PEHS make the device monostable, removing the requirement for overcoming the potential barrier that normally appears in a bistable or tristable system. A theoretical model for the PEHS is established and experimentally validated, with which the PEHS is investigated under both harmonic excitations and random excitations. The results indicate that the operating frequency range of the PEHS can be tuned toward the lower frequency by changing the (mass-magnet) gap between the tip mass and the external magnets, making the efficient energy harvesting from low-frequency excitations possible. For a given harmonic excitation, the PEHS can provide a larger power output and wider operating bandwidth than the linear PEH no matter what way the frequency sweep is conducted. Moreover, compared with the linear PEH, improved power output can also be attained under the Gaussian white noise with a small intensity, enabling the PEHS to deliver useful power even in the presence of small random excitations. Although the optimal PEHS configuration in terms of mass-magnet gap is found to vary slightly with the excitation levels, there exists a certain gap that can guarantee the optimal or near optimal performance of the PEHS under both low-level harmonic excitations and low-intensity random excitations, demonstrating the harvester's superior adaptation to the ambient excitations with variable strengths. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy harvesting; Low-frequency vibration; Monostable configuration; Piezoelectric effect; Random excitation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051654315

While water and energy systems are intrinsically linked, the availability of comprehensive, integrated data sets across the domains of water and energy is generally lacking. As a result, estimated indicators representing volumes of water usage per unit of electricity or fuel produced are often required to analyse the water-energy nexus. In this paper, an “ensemble” of indicators is assembled representing water usage spanning different electricity-generation technologies based on previously published works in an attempt to depict the level or lack of detail in current large-scale energy-sector water-usage data. Based on these, the degree in which using such estimates is suitable for reproducing electricity-production water-usage at coarser spatio-temporal scales is assessed. The performance of the ensemble median/min/max as a predictor of water use is evaluated for the period from 1980 to 2015 using additional information about the constituents of the European energy system. Comparing with the reported values for 1980–2015, the median provides a skillful reproduction of historical yearly water use for the EU (EU28) as a whole. A further analysis for 2015 indicates that reasonable agreement is also seen at the country level. Thus, the results suggest that an “ensemble-based approach” has the potential to provide sturdy estimates of yearly water use by energy systems for analyses at both the country and regional levels. © 2018 The Authors","Energy systems; Europe; Large-scale water analysis; Water intensity factor; Water management; Water withdrawal",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054816737

This paper summarizes seasonal and interannual fluctuations of energy and water balance components in two distinctive semiarid ecosystems, sagebrush (SB) and lodgepole pine (LP) in the Snake River basin of Idaho. This study includes 6 years (2011–2016) of eddy covariance (EC) along with modeled estimates. An analysis of the energy balance indicated a higher energy balance ratio (0.88) for SB than for LP (0.86). The inclusion of canopy storage (CS) increased the association between turbulent fluxes and available energy in LP. Green vegetation fraction (GVF) significantly controlled evapotranspiration (ET) and surface energy partitioning when available energy and soil moisture were not limited. Seasonal water balance in the Budyko framework showed severe water-limited conditions in SB (6–9 months) compared to LP (6–7 months). Based on the validated Noah land surface model estimates, direct soil evaporation (ESoil) is the main component of ET (62 to 79%) in SB due to a large proportion of bare soil (60%), whereas at the lodgepole pine site, it was transpiration (ETran, 42–52%). A complementary ratio (CR) analysis on ET and potential ET (PET) showed a strong asymmetric CR in SB, indicating significant advection. Both SG and LP showed strong coupling between soil moisture (SM) and air temperature (Ta). However, a weak coupling was observed in SB when the soil was dry and Ta was high. This weak coupling was due to the presence of net advection.

But there are currently neither harmonised guidelines nor legal requirements that clearly define the method and the rules to follow to monitor on-board fuel consumption for each situation during navigation. In this context, this article describes and compares four existing methods (EPA, IMO, Jalkanen and MAN) for calculating energy consumption and emissions, and presents a more realistic method, based on a case study. The purpose is to examine the differences between all of these methods, in order to propose the most suitable method of obtaining the data needed for better energy management, and a method that can be applied to any type of ship. The case study was carried out on Ro-Pax ships, comparing these four different methods through the application of a bottom-up integrated system approach. The study describes in detail and applies the most complete methodology for calculating energy consumption and emissions during cruising, operating in a Speed Reduction Zone (SRZ), manoeuvring and berthing.

Ultrafiltration membrane was used and made of polyether-sulfone with a molecular weight cut off (MWCO) of 150 kDa. Results indicated that low DNP concentration (15–30 mg/g VSS) aggravated membrane fouling because more soluble microbial products were released and then rejected by the membrane, which significantly increased cake layer resistance compared with the control. Conversely, a high dosage of DNP (45 mg/g VSS) retarded membrane fouling owing to the high inhibition of extracellular polymeric substances (proteins and polysaccharides) of the sludge, which effectively prevented the formation of cake layer on the membrane surface.

The purpose of this study was to develop physical models based on energy balance equations for normalization of satellite derived LST relative to environmental parameters. For this purpose, a set of remote sensing imagery, meteorological and climatic data recorded in synoptic stations, and soil temperatures measured by data loggers were used. For modeling and normalization of LST, a dual-source energy balance model (dual-EB), taking into account two fractions of vegetation and soil, and a triple -source energy balance model (triple-EB), taking into account three fractions of vegetation, soil and built-up land, were proposed with either regional or local optimization strategies. To evaluate and compare the accuracy of different modeling results, correlation coefficients and root mean square difference (RMSE) were computed between modeled LST and LST obtained from satellite imagery, as well as between modeled LST and soil temperature measured by data loggers. Further, the variance of normalized LST values was calculated and analyzed. The results suggested that the use of local optimization strategy increased the accuracy of the normalization of LST, compared to the regional optimization strategy. In addition, no matter the regional or local optimization strategy was employed, the triple-EB model out-performed consistently the dual-EB model for LST normalization. The results show the efficiency of the local triple-EB model to normalize LST relative to environmental parameters. The correlation coefficients were close to zero between all of the environmental parameters and the normalized LST. In other words, normalized LST was completely independent of the environmental parameters considered by this research. © 2018","Environmental parameters; Land surface temperature; Local and regional optimization; Mountain-urban areas; Normalization; Surface energy balance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052970178

The impacts of spacer types (1-D, 2-D, and 3-D), parallel distance of spacers to the membrane, vibration frequency and amplitude, and intermittent vibration interval on membrane fouling potential were examined. The results showed that vibration of 3-D spacers (sinusoidal geometry) could achieve up to 48% and 25% more fouling reduction than 1-D (flat plate) and 2-D (flat plate with grooves) spacers respectively when the spacers were located at a distance of 0.1 mm to the membrane. Increasing vibration frequency of the 3-D spacer from 1 to 2.5 Hz and increasing amplitude from 0.8 to 2 cm improved membrane fouling control efficiency by 33% and 34% respectively. The improved membrane performance was attributed to combined effects of the enhanced turbulence kinetic energy associated with back-transport of foulants and shear rate on the membrane surface as illustrated by the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3-D CFD) simulations.

H2 atmosphere is proved to be a more prominent way to slow down the decomposition of organic Si–CH3 group than N2 and air atmospheres. The surface area, micropore volume and porosity of palladium-doped silica membrane material calcined in H2 atmosphere are much higher than those calcined in N2 atmosphere.

However, the thermodynamic mechanism of direct alloying between W and Cu is not yet clear. In this paper, a thermodynamic model has been established for direct alloying between W and Cu based on Miedema's theory. Combining the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests for the storage energy in W and Cu, the analysis results based on the model show that the initial energies of W-Cu system including the surface energy, the storage energy and energy caused by external pressure are able to overcome the positive reaction heat and serve as the driving forces for the direct alloying. In other words, the direct alloying between immiscible W and Cu is thermodynamically feasible. Additionally, the thermodynamic analysis results also show that the final alloying microstructure of W-Cu system depends on whether the initial energy is larger than the Gibbs free energy change of W/Cu amorphous phase formation and the cooling rates during the alloying. These thermodynamic calculation results agree well with the experimental results. The amorphous phase is more likely formed during powder metallurgical sintering than during diffusion bonding of W and Cu rods. Lastly, the analysis results explain well why the key to realize direct alloying between W and Cu is to control the alloying temperature at a critical temperature range closes to TmCu. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Direct alloying; Immiscible W-Cu system; Storage energy; Surface energy; Thermodynamic mechanism",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054608775

With DED, an intermediate buffer layer is introduced between a bottom (P21) and a top (316L) layer. The relative compositions (wt%) of the three layers are 0:100, 50:50, and 100:0. Microstructure and mechanical properties were characterized via optical microscopy, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), Vickers microhardness, and miniaturized tensile testing in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC). Finite element simulations were also conducted to obtain the local stress and strain states in the MLMs to elucidate the bulk plastic deformation behavior. The main finding was that the intermediate buffer layer, when processed with a mixture of P21 and 316L alloys, exhibited superior mechanical properties such as continuous yielding, a low yield to tensile strength, and a high work-hardening rate. The macroscopic deformation behavior was related to the initial microstructure that consisted of a small fraction of retained austenite and fine α′ martensite. During a compression test to study the bulk deformation behavior, MLMs with an intermediate buffer layer exhibited a relatively superior load-carrying capacity compared with MLMs without an intermediate buffer layer. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Direct energy deposition; Mechanical property; Microstructure; Multi-layered material",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054659402

The second dataset consists of four deliberative workshops (n = 46) exploring public perceptions of energy storage. We find that energy is explicitly discussed as a basic need because of its perceived role in ensuring survival, good health and a decent life. This is particularly salient when considering the wellbeing of vulnerable groups. We suggests that ‘energy as a need’ provides a framework for people's evaluation of proposed changes to the wider energy system including how energy is produced, consumed and governed, and discuss implications for policy and practitioners that seek to ensure low-carbon energy transitions are successful, inclusive and socially acceptable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy justice; Energy needs; Energy transitions; Public perception",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054306164

The primary data for the study were assembled during the feasibility assessment and implementation phases. The following attributes of the village are classified as opportunities: abundant solar radiation, hilltop location, self-help ethos, environmental stewardship, and effective traditional administrative system. Conversely, the following factors in, or directly tied to, the village were identified as obstacles: small economy and lack of skilled technicians, sparse spatial layout, lack of RET infrastructure, low wind speed, and intense and protracted rainy season, the outdated national energy policy, and recent international economic crisis and environmental politics. These findings hold lessons for RET policymaking and research in Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African countries.

As momentum grows for this form of energy transition this paper draws together research on small-scale solar in six different countries – Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mozambique, Sri Lanka and South Africa – to argue for a need to understand how, when, and for whom solar provides energy access. It argues that an assemblage perspective can provide vital insights into the diversity and dynamism of energy access. The paper demonstrates that the diverse ways in which solar provides energy access is a function of the flexibility/fixity of the socio-technical assemblage and the de/centralisation of agency. The central thesis of this paper is that energy access is fluid and ever changing and we need fluid, easily maintainable, locally modifiable ‘assemblages’ for providing such access. Using this perspective, we find three common features of solar energy access across our case studies. First, there are significant gaps between what solar projects are designed to achieve and what they deliver, which are highly contingent on the flexibility of their structure and the decentralisation of agency within them. Second, access needs to endure continuously. Third, to foster enduring access, projects should embed logics of improvisation.

Our study suggests that Qatar's residential PV adoption is strongly promoted by the falling cost of PV and can be further facilitated through the reduction of electricity subsidies and the extension of the electricity tariff to Qatari households, which are currently exempt.

This paper seeks to classify, analyze and summarize the possibilities of the thermoelectric technology integration in buildings. The results obtained from the search were divided into two main groups: systems that are integrated in the building envelope and non-integrated systems that operate independently. Among the analyzed parameters, on the one hand the characteristics of the prototypes’ components needed for the construction were described. On the other, the thermoelectric specific parameters required for optimization under the operating scenarios’ conditions were studied. The results of most of the studies showed that even though the technology can provide the comfort conditions, still the performance of these systems is not competitive compared to conventional vapor compression systems. However, the advantages of thermoelectricity such us the non-use of refrigerants or the high durability, makes this technology an alternative solution to consider, of which interest is growing in line with recent studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Architecture; Building services; Energy; HVAC; Integration; Peltier",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053137993

A structural vector autoregression model is thus estimated using a novel dataset of quarterly macroeconomic and energy data for Portugal.

In multi-antenna wireless networks, the energy conservation problem can be addressed using the trade-off between the transmit power and the circuit energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a cross layer protocol, MAC-LEAP, that selects the best transmission policy based on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in both single-hop and multi-hop wireless networks. Various data transmission algorithms are presented in which many factors are considered in order to find the best transmission policy between each pair of nodes. An RTS/CTS handshake is used to exchange the required information to select the best transmission policy prior to data transmission. Moreover, we introduce a MIMO-based framework in Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) in which the wireless nodes may be equipped with more than one antenna. Using extensive simulations in ns-3, we compare the performance of MAC-LEAP with traditional protocols in terms of the network lifetime and the number of received packets.

This paper investigates the interaction of a 10MWe P2G facility with an island electricity grid with limited interconnection, through modelling electricity purchase. Three models are tested; 2016 at 25% renewable electricity penetration and 2030 at both 40% and 60% penetration levels.

Bidding for electricity above the average marginal cost of generation in the system (€35–50/MWeh) was found to minimise the LCOE in all three scenarios. The frequency of low-cost and high-costs hours, analogous to balancing issues, increased with increasing shares of variable renewable electricity generation. However, basing P2G systems on low-cost (less than €10/MWeh) hours alone (999 h in 2030 at 60% renewable penetration) is not the path to financial optimisation; it is preferential to increase the run hours to a level that amortises the capital expenditure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity market; Electrofuel; Levelised cost of energy (LCOE); Optimisation; Power-to-gas (P2G); Renewable energy storage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053159198

However, the intermittent nature of DERs poses a new challenge of energy balance within a MG. Trading energy among the MGs has emerged as a well-suited solution. Therefore, we have proposed a novel method for fair and stable energy sharing among MG clusters with minimum information overhead. The novelty of the proposed method lies within the seller level game and introduction of a new pricing mechanism. The concept of an aggregator is used as a mediator between the trading parties. Depending on the priority factor, each buyer MG decides its strategy for energy demand from the surplus using a noncooperative game theory-based algorithm. The interests of seller MGs are protected by allowing them to decide the amount of energy they want to share out of their total surplus. To avoid the selfish behavior of any buyer MG, an algorithm is used by the energy market operator which verifies the strategies submitted by buyer MGs before releasing set points to the generators.

By introducing an auxiliary variable to denote the worst-case balancing cost, we transform the trilevel optimization problem into a single-level model considering generated representative scenarios. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm composed of nested problems, where the master problem solves the single-level robust model considering the binding scenario subset identified by the subproblem. In this way, a more computationally tractable model can be obtained, owing to the greatly reduced number of scenarios.

An optimal design approach is developed for DES design and operation scheduling by using the real site measurements of energy demands. A case study on the DES in a high density district, i.e., a university campus in Hong Kong, is performed. The energy and economic performance of the DES, the matching performance of on-site generations and the efficiency of electric chillers are analyzed and compared with that of the centralized energy system (CES). It can be found that the proposed DES is a cost-effective and energy-efficient technology for the regions concerned. The DES contributes to substantial primary energy saving of 9.6% and a significant reduction in the operating cost of 44%. The distributed generations in the DES can match electricity demand very well around the year while the absorption chillers can match cooling demand well in transition months. Compared with the CES, the DES allows electric chillers of larger capacities to be used and to operate at higher part load ratios, resulting in higher energy efficiency in operation. © 2018","Distributed energy system; District cooling system; Energy performance; Matching performance; Optimal design; Real site measurement",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053127880

In this paper, we first formulate the problem of an energy-efficient online SFC request that is orchestrated across multiple clouds as an integer linear programming (ILP) model to find an optimal solution. Then, we analyze the complexity of this ILP model and prove that the problem is NP-hard. Additionally, we propose a low-complexity heuristic algorithm named energy-efficient online SFC request orchestration across multiple domains (EE-SFCO-MD) for near-optimally solving the mentioned problem. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Simulation results show that EE-SFCO-MD consumes less energy than existing approaches while the online SFC's requirements are met and the privacy of each cloud is effectively guaranteed.

Therefore, developers should pay attention to the energy consumption of the global system so as not to compromise the system lifetime. There are plenty of experimental studies that give hints about how to reduce the energy consumption. However, this knowledge is not readily available for the software developers of cyber–physical systems. They normally use software development environments that do not provide useful advice about the energy consumption of the software solutions being implemented. In this paper, we propose a Developer Eco-Assistant to integrate the experimental results obtained by researchers into the software development environments, so as to increase the energy-awareness of cyber–physical systems developers. In our solution, the energy information is obtained in real-time from a repository of energy consuming concerns, where researchers store their experimental measurements. Developers use the repository to perform sustainability analyses, which, in turn, will lead to greener design/implementation decisions. In this paper, we illustrate the use of our approach in the context of cyber–physical systems development using both open source environments (e.g. JetBrains IDEs) and proprietary environments (e.g. Waspmote development environment).

This strategy enables the system to manage its domestic energy production and consumption autonomously, and trade energy with the local market through a novel hybrid interval-stochastic optimization method. This work poses a residential energy management problem which consists of two stages: day-ahead and real-time. The uncertainty in electricity price and PV power generation is modeled by interval-based and stochastic scenarios in the day-ahead and real-time transactions between the smart home and local electricity market. Moreover, the implementation of a battery included to provide energy flexibility in the residential system. In this paper, the smart home acts as a price-taker agent in the local market, and it submits its optimal offering and bidding curves to the local market based on the uncertainties of the system. Finally, the performance of the proposed residential energy management system is evaluated according to the impacts of interval optimistic and flexibility coefficients, optimal bidding strategy, and uncertainty modeling. The evaluation has shown that the proposed optimal offering model is effective in making the home system robust and achieves optimal energy transaction. Thus, the results prove that the proposed optimal offering model for the domestic energy management system is more robust than its non-optimal offering model. Moreover, battery flexibility has a positive effect on the system's total expected profit.

A new cantilever beam design is presented to achieve this. By introducing an anti-phase motion between the coil and the magnets at resonance under the same base excitation input, the relative velocity of the coil cutting through the magnetic field is significantly increased and hence its power output. An experiment is performed to compare the proposed method with the conventional method where either the coil or the magnet is fixed onto the vibrating base. Under a base acceleration level of 0.10 g and a natural frequency of 17.24 Hz, results shows a 185% increase in power for the proposed method when compared with the conventional method with a recorded maximum power of 7.4 mW at resonance. The power produced by this method is proven to be higher than the sum of power produced by two individual conventional harvesters under the same velocities. In addition, a 22% increase in frequency bandwidth is also recorded by the proposed method. In terms of the power density, the proposed method indicates a 38% increase when compared with the conventional harvester. Results also show a drastic reduction in the maximum power output and phase difference when the natural frequencies of the coil and the magnets differ by only 1.5%, hence defining the importance of frequency matching. Further analysis indicates that a glass fiber cantilever beam showed a higher decrease in electromagnetic damping as compared to the increase in mechanical damping when small bulk masses were added onto the beam, hence increasing its overall gain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cantilever beam; Out-of-phase; Power; Resonance; Vibration energy harvesting",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049346693

Energy efficiency is the critical issue in the design and deployment of WSN since the sensor nodes are powered by batteries with limited capacity. As data transmission is the main power consuming process in WSN, several energy efficient techniques have been proposed. Data compression is a popular energy efficient technique which helps to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted in the network resulting in significant power saving. This paper proposes a new algorithm called neighborhood indexing sequence (NIS) for data compression in WSN. The proposed NIS algorithm dynamically assigns shorter length codewords to each character in the input sequence by exploiting the occurrence of neighboring bits. Using the real world WSN dataset, it is shown that the compression performance of the NIS algorithm is superior to existing compression algorithms. Compared with existing methods, the proposed compression algorithm is not only efficient but also highly robust for different WSN dataset. The proposed algorithm attains a compression ratio of 89.13 with the bit rate of 1.74 per sample. Moreover, it achieved power savings up to 87.57% for the applied WSN dataset. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Character encoding; Data compression; Energy efficiency; Robustness; Wireless sensor networks",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053785681

This paper employs an integrated biophysical, economic and transportation GIS-based model to examine the production of beet-bioethanol from five sites in North Dakota. The study finds that beet-bioethanol could provide net benefits to farmers and ethanol producers in the state, under current market conditions, but only if the bioethanol plant site is carefully selected. Specifically, a 75 million litre plant could produce a profit at capacity offering a beet price of $33/t at an ethanol price of $0.40/L at one of five analyzed sites. Policy initiatives that increase the price of ethanol could make production attractive at all of the investigated sites. Both increased agricultural opportunity costs and decreased transportation costs move feedstock production away from the plant site to higher quality lands. This result implies that, in some cases, to pursue biomass production on marginal lands, policy initiatives would need to increase transportation costs, lower agricultural commodity prices, or increase biomass prices. Therefore, assumptions about land quality should be carefully considered in biomass and bioenergy policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy feedstock; Bioethanol; Biomass; Energy beet; Marginal land; Opportunity cost",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053178770

Here we explore the possibility of financial co-benefits: whether municipal climate policies lead to an enhanced creditworthiness. This would translate into reduced borrowing costs for other infrastructure projects. Interviewing key informants from cities, investment firms and rating agencies, we find that rating agencies do consider climate policies in their ratings. This clearly applies to those climate policies that can result in demonstrable net economic gains to the municipality. However even those mitigation and energy policies that come at net costs to cities can have positive impacts on rating assessments, either because the policies are seen as reducing regulatory risks, or because they send positive signals to those investors having global sustainability agendas. Interestingly, those least aware of these factors appear to be city leaders themselves.

This paper proposes a two-stage scenario-based planning model for large-scale wind farms development, based on a project management approach. Considering a 10-year project of large wind farms development, the annual installation capacities of wind turbines are first optimally planned in order to minimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of wind farms. Second, as wind power penetration is consistently increasing in the grid, some stability concerns will come up such as voltage instability. To remedy this condition, the optimum dispatch of grid's conventional power sources and control variables is determined in such a way that not only in any state of operation (taking into account wind and load uncertainties) but also in post-contingency conditions, the prescribed security margin is ensured at the lowest possible cost. This study has been conducted on an actual power system of Iran's southeast grid, as well as IEEE 118-bus standard test system. Also, modified crow search algorithm (MCSA) is utilized to solve the developed optimization model.

Binary energy is defined in terms of inhomogeneity in local point density. While most previous methods use binary/pairwise energy only, the unary/data energy can represent the natural tendency of a given point belonging to a given cluster, which is also crucial for the clustering. Since our energy is expressed as the sum of a unary (data) term and a binary (pairwise or smoothness) term, we can thus make a perfect analogy with the energy model used in vision and borrow everything (such as the optimization algorithms) from vision field to clustering under this mapping. This correspondence provides an entirely new view point in handling the clustering problem, and in fact many mature methods and algorithms are already provided in the vision field and can be adopted by the clustering field readily. During our energy optimization, a sequence of energy minima are found to recursively partition the points, and thus find a hierarchical embedding of clusters that are increasingly homogeneous in density. Disjoint clusters with the same density are identified separately. Our clustering method is totally unsupervised (which is superior to most existing methods, as those listed below). It does not need any user input parameters (say number of segments, any bandwidth parameter, cutoff distance/scale, etc.), except one can specify the homogeneity criterion — the degree of acceptable fluctuation in density within a cluster (which is target-related), or let it be specified automatically in a hierarchical way. We conduct experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-image tasks. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that our method is able to handle clusters of different shapes, sizes and densities. We present the performance of our approach using the commonly used energy optimization algorithms from vision such as ICM, LBP, Graph-cut, Mean field theory algorithm, as well as the integer programming algorithm. We also contrast our performance with several other commonly used clustering algorithms, such as k-means, fussy c-means, DBSCAN, as well as a recent state-of-the-art clustering method as reported in [40]. Our experiments on real-image tasks further validate the performance of the method. In addition, we show that the family of commonly used spectral, graph clustering algorithms (such as Normalized-cut) uses only the binary energy term while ignoring the unary energy term; therefore, their energy model is incomplete compared with ours. © 2018","Connected component analysis; Energy minimization; Image segmentation; Integer programming; Ising model; Local density; Normalized-cut; Statistical physics; Unary/data energy; Unsupervised/hierarchical clustering",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054093472

However, the molecular mechanisms of the long-lived cell membrane permeability, which persists on the minutes time scale after the pulse treatment, remain elusive.

In this study we make the first important step in quantifying the possible contribution of lipid peroxidation to electropermeabilization. We use free energy calculations to quantify the permeability and conductance of bilayers, containing an increasing percentage of hydroperoxide lipid derivatives, to sodium and chloride ions. We then compare our calculations to experimental measurements on electropermeabilized cells. Our results show that the permeability and conductance increase dramatically by several orders of magnitude in peroxidized bilayers. Yet this increase is not sufficient to reasonably account for the entire range of experimental measurements. Nevertheless, lipid peroxidation might be considered an important mechanism of prolonged membrane permeabilization, if exposure of cells to high voltage electric pulses leads to secondary lipid peroxidation products.

Analytical or numerical modelling of the heterogeneous MFC as a homogenous material with equivalent properties is usually required to predict the performance of the transducers. However, the equivalent properties reported in the literature are not suitable for this purpose. This work proposes an equal power-output method to numerically evaluate the equivalent properties of d31 type MFCs for piezoelectric transducer modelling. Taking energy harvesting application as a study case, it departs from the traditional method by applying electric assumptions that ensure the equal voltage, electric charge, and thus equal power output between the heterogeneous and homogeneous MFCs. The equivalent properties were characterised through the finite element (FE) analysis of the MFC's representative volume element (RVE), which is the minimum periodic unit in the MFC and takes account all the constitutes. The validity of these equivalent properties for energy harvesting transducer modelling was verified by FE modelling as well as experimental testing. The application of the equivalent properties for actuation and sensing transducer modelling was analysed and validated. FE modelling results showed that a homogeneous RVE with the equivalent properties accurately simulated the energy harvesting and actuation behaviours of the heterogeneous RVE. The simulated power output of MFC-based strain energy harvesters matched the mean experimental results with a mean error of 2.5%. When used for actuation, the MFC produced a free strain of 0.93 με/V, which is close to the manufacturer specification. © 2018 The Authors","Energy harvesting; Equivalent properties; Finite element modelling; Homogenization; Macro-fibre composite (MFC)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054086116

The optimised air-based EPCM system utilised a high and low melting temperature phase change material (PCM) with a sensible storage filler. It was found that a capsule radius of 10 mm and PCM volume of 13% resulted in the lowest cost of discharged thermal energy of $25.55/kWh when storage effectiveness and pumping power was considered.

By solving an hourly system generation and demand profile, it was found that a concentrated solar thermal (CST) and photovoltaic (PV) system coupled with TES was able to economically reduce gas consumption by 45–65% when the price of gas was $30/GJ.

Different working conditions and coupling and commutation procedures to mains are considered in the analysis. Results are then compared to the limits recommended by regulatory bodies for spurious emissions from communication systems in this frequency band, as no specific limits for DERs have been established.

The proposed method employs an element-wise, time domain-based approach. Identification of elemental structural properties is performed through least squares optimization of an objective function created from the rate of total energy of the targeted elements. Using the total energy rate allows for a significant simplification in creating the objective function as compared to previous approaches that rely on equations of motion. Moreover, introduction of boundary elements’ contribution in the derived objective functions makes the method flexible. As a result, it can be applied either to the whole structure or to any specific portion of the structure. In this novel approach, DITER converts displacement data into total displacement, measured from the undeformed configuration of the structure, by introducing static deflection correction terms. Thus, the proposed method is robust against static deflection variation and eliminates uncertainties in the initial displacement values. Numerical verification of the DITER method was performed on a two-span beam sample. Based on the results, DITER can be used as an efficient tool for nondestructive damage detection in existing structures. © 2018","Energy rate; Nondestructive evaluation; Static deflection variation; Structural damage detection; System identification",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054445593

However, the benefits and risks vary across markets and time, which justifies the importance to optimize ES capacity share in different markets. In this paper, a novel portfolio theory-based approach is proposed for optimally managing ES in various markets to maximize benefits and reduce the risk for ES owners. Three markets are considered, which are energy arbitrage, ancillary services, and distributed network operator's market. They are modeled based on energy cost, frequency response cost, and system congestion cost. Portfolio theory is utilized to quantify ES capacity allocated to each market over time for various levels of risk aversions. The relation between risks and expected return of different markets is efficiently reflected by the portfolio theory, providing implications to storage operation. The extensive demonstration illustrates that the markets that storage can participate in are fundamentally different regarding to its risk aversion. In addition, the optimum portfolio of the markets for storage is on the efficient frontier, providing the maximum return at a certain risk aversion level. This study is particularly useful for guiding market participation and operation of ES to gain maximum economic return at minimum risk. © 2018 IEEE.","Ancillary market; distributed network operator's (DNO's) market; electricity market; energy storage (ES); portfolio; risk",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044315368

Especially, traditional electricity consumers evolve into prosumers who produce as well as consume electricity in modern power electric systems. In this evolution, the electric power industry has tried to introduce the notion of local energy markets for prosumers. In the local energy market, prosumers purchase electricity from distributed energy generators or the other prosumers with surplus electricity via a local power exchange center. For this purpose, this paper proposes joint geometric clustering and truthful auction schemes in the local energy markets. The proposed clustering scheme is designed for distribution fairness of the distributed energy generator for serving prosumers, where the scheme is inspired by expectation and maximization based unsupervised learning. Moreover, this paper proposes an auction mechanism for truthful electricity trading in a local energy market. In order to guarantee truthful electricity trading, the proposed auction mechanism is constructed based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction, which was proven to guarantee truthful operations. The Hungarian method is also considered in addition to the auction. The simulation results for the auction verify that the utilities of local market energy entities are maximized when the prosumers are truthful. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Clustering; local energy market; local power exchange center; smart grid; Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049306086

However, uncertainties such as intermittent renewable energy injection present challenges to energy hub optimization. This paper solves the optimal energy flow of adjacent energy hubs to minimize the energy costs by utilizing the flexibility of energy resources in a smart city with uncertain renewable generation. It innovatively models the power and gas flows between hubs using chance constraints, thus permitting the temporary overloading acceptable on real energy networks. This novelty not only ensures system security but also helps reduce or defer network investment. By restricting the probability of chance constraints over a specific level, the energy hub optimization is formulated as a multiperiod stochastic problem with the total generation cost as the objective. Cornish-Fisher expansion is utilized to incorporate the chance constraints into the optimization, which transforms the stochastic problem into a deterministic problem. The interior-point method is then applied to resolve the developed model. The proposed chance-constrained optimization is demonstrated on a three-hub system and results extensively illustrate the impact of chance constraints on power and gas flows.

Simulation results demonstrate that the Voronoi Diagram-based algorithm minimizes the average energy consumption and query response time. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","IoT energy efficiency; Multi-dimensional data indexing; Range query processing; Voronoi diagram",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053787073

In order to improve the profitability of the fast-charging stations and to decrease the high energy demanded from the grid, the station includes renewable generation (wind and photovoltaic) and a storage system. Unlike other papers, this one uses a detailed model of the charging process that considers the arrival time and state of charge of electric vehicles. First, the Monte Carlo method is used to model the EV demand and the renewable generation. Later, a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes the installation and operation of the EV fast-charging station. It finds the optimal solution that maximizes the profit measured by its net present value (NPV). Several cases are studied to analyse the influence of renewable energies and storage systems. The obtained results show that a mix of renewable energies and storage systems attains the best cost efficient solution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle (EV); Fast-charging station; Genetic algorithm and renewable energy; Monte Carlo method",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051486692

For electricity sector, the interventions are predominantly in terms of mainstreaming renewable energy sources. Consequently, there is a consistent increase in the share of renewable energy-based electricity systems which has caused emergence of several new challenges. The challenges have emerged both with respect to planning and management of the transitioning electricity systems. These new challenges are because of shift away from supply-chain influenced conventional energy resource supply to nature influenced dynamic renewable energy resource supply; shift from conventional firm power to renewable intermittent power; operational complexities due to frequent and steeper ramps; and need for matching dynamic demand for power. We propose, develop and validate a novel approach for better representation of these resource-supply-demand dynamics in evolving suite of generation expansion models with operational details. First, we discuss development of an electricity generation expansion planning model with operational details. Second, to model the dynamic nature of renewable energy resources and demand for power, we develop an approach for generating annual wind and solar resource profiles, and representative load curves respectively, and harmonizing them before they are fed into the generation expansion model. We validate this approach using India's electricity system data and use the model to evaluate implications of varying levels of renewable energy integration. We find that this increased penetration of renewable energy while bringing significant climate change benefits creates substantial capacity redundancy leading to lower capacity utilization of the overall system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity system transition; Generation expansion planning; Power system modelling; Renewable energy integration; Sustainability transition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053078303

Adopting existing removal technologies that are successful in large-scale treatment to POU units, however, is rather ineffective due to the short hydraulic residence time in POU systems. In this study, we investigated the use of iron-containing ordered mesoporous carbon (FeOMC) for rapid arsenate [As(V)] sorption in batch reactors. The OMC was prepared by an evaporation-induced self-assembly approach followed by impregnation of iron oxides, which was identified mainly as maghemite (γ-Fe2O3) by coupled high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy microanalysis. A rapid kinetics of As(V) adsorption was observed, showing that at an initial concentration of 52.1 μg As/L and solid loading of 2.0 g/L, 84.8% of As(V) was removed within 90 s at pH 6.1. The kinetics was satisfactorily modelled according to the mass transfer of As(V) in a single FeOMC grain; and the results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion along the mesoporous channels could be hindered by adsorption. In summary, this study has not only developed ordered mesoporous materials for rapid arsenic adsorption, but also gained insights into the factors controlling the sorption kinetics by evaluating the mass transfer inside the straight and uniform channels of surface-functionalized OMC. © 2018","Adsorption kinetics; Arsenate adsorption; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Mesopore-scale mass transfer modeling; Ordered mesoporous carbon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053823800

The mechanical system under consideration, which is to follow a class of prescribed constraints, contains (possibly fast) time-varying uncertainty.

Two categories of adaptation laws, both are based on self-adjusting leakage, are proposed. The control guarantees uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of a performance measure. Comparing with the previous control scheme, the importance of this new control is that it can compensate the uncertainty in a very effective way. It also avoids over compensation and renders modest control effort. For demonstration purpose, the Toda Lattice, an ideal model of mechanical system with asymmetrical behaviour is chosen.

However, it is believed that they will soon start to exert negative impact on stakeholders and on the grid.

This work quantifies the impact of these traditional policies in future “what-if” scenarios and confirms the need for their replacement. Based on simulations with real data, we compare net metering and feed-in tariff to four state-of-the-art market-based mechanisms, which involve auction, negotiation and bitcoin-like currency.

Although during recent years, numerous of the previous studies have been very thoroughly investigated the nexus between economic growth and CO2 emissions, there is a lack of research regarding the qualitative systematic review and meta-analysis in these areas. The main purpose of this review paper is to present the comprehensive overview of the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth. In this regard, the Web of Science database has been chosen and a qualitative systematic and meta-analysis method which called “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)” has been proposed. Therefore, a review of 175 published articles appearing in 55 scholarly international journals between 1995 and 2017 has been achieved to reach a broad review of the nexus between economic growth and CO2 emissions with other indicators. Consequently, the selected articles have been categorized by the author name, the year of publication, data duration, types of techniques, data analysis method, the name of indicators, country, scope (individual country and multi-countries), journals, results, and outcome in which they appeared. The results of this paper demonstrated that the nexus between CO2 emissions and economic growth gives reasons for policy options that have to reduce emissions by imposing limiting factors on economic growth as well. Given the fact that bidirectional causality exists, as far as economic growth increases or decreases, further CO2 emissions are stimulated in higher or lower levels and consequently, a potential reduction of the emissions should have an adverse influence on economic growth. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052287825

In this paper, an optimization model is provided for participation of a DER aggregator in the day-ahead market in the presence of demand flexibility. This player behaves as an energy aggregator, which manages energy and financial interactions between the market and DER organized in local energy systems (LES), which are in charge to satisfy the multienergy demand of a set of building clusters with flexible demand. A stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem is formulated by considering uncertainties of intermittent DER facilities and day-ahead market price, to find the optimal bidding strategies while maximizing the expected aggregator's profit.

Therefore, additional balancing power is required to integrate the variable wind power in the CHP-based heat and electricity integrated energy system (HE-IES). This paper expands the demand response (DR) concept to the HE-IES. A comprehensive DR strategy combining energy substitution and load shifting is first developed to exploit the demand flexibility of smart buildings. Besides electric balancing power, heat balancing power is also provided to relax the production constrains of CHP units. Moreover, a real-time DR exchange (DRX) market is developed where the building aggregators are stimulated to adjust buildings' energy consumption behaviors and provide the required balancing power.

It is demonstrated that surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was successfully induced with ion irradiation initially at a fluence of 3 × 1014 ions cm−2 and is observed to be first red shifted and then blue shifted on increasing fluence of ion irradiation. The results of Raman spectroscopy reveal the progressive transformation of fullerene C70 into amorphous carbon with increasing fluence. The I(D)/I(G) ratio is calculated to analyze amorphous carbon and improved ordering of amorphous carbon at higher fluences is observed. TEM images verified the continuous growth of copper nanoparticles subjected to low energy ion irradiation with increasing fluence which is ascribed to the agglomeration of particles as pointed by EDS mapping images. FTIR results show that the destruction of fullerene C70 matrix is initiated at a fluence of 3 × 1014 ions cm−2, which coincides with the appearance of SPR band.

However, as they need to be driven by electric energy, their ecological efficiency depends not only on their performance, but also on the energy mix used for electricity generation. Effectiveness of HP can be improved by applying renewable energy sources (RES) providing electricity to drive the system. In order to properly assess such a system, it should be evaluated within a global balance boundary reaching the level of primary resources. The authors propose the use of thermo-ecological cost (TEC) indices for exergo-ecological assessment. TEC is defined as cumulative consumption of non-renewable exergy connected with the fabrication of a particular product. TEC also includes additional consumption of non-renewable natural resources which results from the necessity of compensating environmental losses caused by rejection of harmful substances to the environment. Within the paper, a HP system has been analysed from the ecological point of view. The system consists of a heat pump driven by electricity, and photovoltaic panels or wind turbines as a basic source of electricity. The balance of electricity demand for HP is complemented by electricity from grid. To evaluate this system, real environmental data on solar radiation, wind and ambient temperature deciding on heat demand have been taken into account. The authors present the ecological benefits resulting from supporting heat pumps by electricity generated in RES. It has been demonstrated by comparing results obtained within local and global balance boundaries, that the second approach should be consequently applied when systems based on a mix of renewable and non-renewable energy are analysed, since the first approach may lead to misleading conclusions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Exergy and ecology; Heat pump; Renewable energy sources; Thermo-ecological cost",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053126614

At present, most existing energy saving works considered the network energy saving from the dimension of time or power separately. However, in fact these two dimensions can interact with each other, i.e., reducing the network delay may lead to the increase of network energy consumption, and vice versa. In this paper, two dimensions of time and power are comprehensively studied in the Minimum Network Energy Consumption (MNEC) problem. First of all, we formulate the MNEC problem by considering both time and power, and prove that it is a NP-hard problem. Furthermore, we propose a heuristic Integrated Time and Power (ITP) algorithm, which combines the link sharing avoidance algorithm to reduce the network delay from the dimension of time as well as the switch aggregation algorithm to reduce the energy consumption from the power dimension. Finally, the performance of ITP algorithm is evaluated under different network topology, network size, traffic size and flow number under the network environment based on Mininet and Ryu controller. Experimental results show that the ITP algorithm outperforms the existing network energy saving algorithm in terms of energy consumption. © 2018","Energy saving; Heuristic algorithm; Link sharing avoidance; Software defined data center networks; Switch aggregation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052916520

However, based on the traditional analysis of the pressure drop, the irreversible loss after cavitation can barely be displayed quantitatively. To solve this problem, an entropy production diagnostic model (EPDM) by the contribution of viscous entropy production (VEP), turbulent entropy production (TEP) and wall entropy production (WEP) for the cavitation flow was established to calculate the energy loss. The cryogenic cavitation model and proposed EPDM were proved to be reliable after comparing results with Hord's experiment in an ogive and cavitation experiment in a centrifugal pump. Then, by studying the total entropy production, it was found that the EPDM could well predict the occurrence of the critical cavitation and the deterioration of cavitation. When compared with TEP and WEP, the effect of VEP is negligible. As the cavitation area expands from the suction surface of inducer (id) to the first-stage impeller (impA), the cavitation process can be divided into three stages and the total energy loss increases significantly from the first stage to the third one. Through the global distribution of energy loss, it was found that the faster growth of the loss in the second-stage impeller (impB) and the second-stage guide vane (gvB), not in id and impA, contributes more to the energy loss after cavitation. Finally, from the variation of ratio of TEP to WEP, it reveals that cavitation has a greater effect on the WEP rate for the impB, but the turbulent viscous dissipation is still dominant, while the eddy dissipation and resistance loss in gvB with the evolution of cavitation are both crucial. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cavitation flow; Energy loss analysis; Entropy production diagnostic model; LNG cryogenic submerged pump",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054063694

The effect of wettability and surface energy on ice adhesion has recently received attention. However, the verification of icephobicity is typically carried out with a single observation method. For this study, rough modified rod-coated surfaces, structured polymer surfaces and nine smooth surfaces with tunable wettability were fabricated. Combining several observation techniques of icephobicity indicate that petal and lotus surfaces lose their superhydrophobicity, being less useful for ice repellency due to poor humidity tolerance in condensation conditions. The ice adhesion of rough surfaces enhanced with increasing hydrophobicity. The increased interface area leads to a reduction of the icephobic performance. The stress concentrator on the lotus surface was better than on the petal surface. In addition, the role of dynamic wettability on ice adhesion was checked. Smooth hydrophobic surfaces were found to be better icephobic materials compared to rough surfaces. The intrinsic surface energy of smooth surfaces is significantly linear with the ice adhesion.

Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy is an effective way to reduce carbon emissions and, therefore, a series of targets for renewable electricity generation have been put forward in national plans. However, how these targets will be reached is unclear. This paper uses a Long-range Energy Alternative Planning system (LEAP) model to explore the optimum development path of China's power sector from 2015 to 2050, taking into consideration the impacts of the renewable energy targets. Three scenarios are designed to examine the costs and benefits of developing renewable energy and improving the technologies for renewable power generation, comprising a base scenario, a renewable energy policy scenario and a technological progress scenario. The results show that the power generation cost would increase by at least 2.31 trillion RMB and that CO2 emissions would be reduced by 35.8 billion tonnes during 2015–2050 if power generation follows current planning. Furthermore, every 1% increase in the capacity factors of renewable electricity would on average result in the cumulative CO2 emissions decreased by 979 million tonnes and average CO2 abatement cost decreased by 5.56 RMB/tCO2 during 2015–2050. Based on this study, several policy implications are proposed for the development of power sector in China. Firstly, government may reconsider the current planning for gas-fired power and nuclear power to reach low-carbon electricity generation. Secondly, adjusting the carbon price can offset the additional cost of renewable electricity generation.

The first–order approximation analysis reveals three various types of triple–mode resonant ensembles consisting of one longitudinal wave and a pair of transverse modes being in phase. In turn, the nonlinear coupling between triads of various types and spectral states creates stationary multi-mode resonant ensembles. The corresponding stationary multi-mode solutions exhibit Lyapunov–stable quasiperiodic orbits in contrast to chaotic motions inherent in the same system. It is found that the energy distribution in microtubules being in thermal equilibrium is described by a recursive function that cannot be reduced to well-known classical statistical laws. Also, multi-frequency envelope solitons, taking place far from the thermal equilibrium of a microtubule, are possible when getting some portion of energy from the environment. The mechanical momentum of such solitons can propagate along microtubules without dispersion in long distances that can help for efficient heat exchange as well as in providing coherent movement of motor organelles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amplitude dispersion; Microtubule; Multi-frequency envelope soliton; Resonant triad; Stationary energy distribution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051798600

Composite structures are more and more used for their lightness and their high performance in fatigue solicitations. Nevertheless, metallic materials remain essential for some functions, which sometimes lead to the creation of hybrid structures, achievable with the use of bonding techniques. The bonding of metallic materials over composite, requires accurate knowledge of bonding properties in static and fatigue, including the capability to perform a residual strength assessment in case of local damage such as a discrete disbond. In order to test the fracture mechanics properties of the adhesive, modified specimens such as the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) were used. Because of the materials' stiffness difference, they were specially designed to produce a pure mode I in the crack plane. The strain energy release rate, G, was chosen as the governing fracture parameter. The classic way to test specimens in fatigue is controlling the displacement (or the force) of the actuator. The new approach proposed in this paper, consists in controlling the variation of energy (ΔG) during the fatigue tests, thus a user-specified constant value of ΔG will be applied on the specimens.

Proper quantum–mechanical relations between the uniaxial SIA constant K and the axial ZFS parameter D valid for the cases D > 0 and D < 0, as well as integer and half-integer spins, including S = 1/2, are derived.

In brief, the method involves first clustering historical data into different day types, and then estimating PV and demand models using kernel regression. Clustering is done to capture intraday variations in the PV and demand profiles, with the aim of capturing much of these intertemporal correlations in the day-type labels. This allows the draws from the kernel estimates within a day type to be done independently. This approach conforms with a Markov decision process construction of the smart home energy management system (SHEMS) problem, which is the ultimate target of the modeling procedure. Moreover, in practical applications, the SHEMS will need the type of a coming day in order to select a daily demand model, which can be done seamlessly using state identification methods. In comparison, forecasting a day's demand profile using time series forecasting methods produces a prediction method that does not provide a probability structure that is directly incorporated into a Markov decision process scheduling model. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Clustering; demand model; dynamic programming (DP); kernel regression; Markov decision process (MDP); residential PV model; smart home energy management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049474400

Aims: Evaluate the enzyme activity of Ndel1 and ACE in euthymic individuals with BD type 1 which was compare to healthy control (HC) group. Methods: Ndel1 and ACE activities were assessed in the serum of individuals with BD type 1 according to DSM-IV criteria (n = 70) and a HC group (n = 34). The possible differences between BD type 1 and HC groups were evaluated using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), and the results were adjusted for age, gender and body mass index. Results: We observed a positive correlation between Ndel1 activity and the total YMRS score in BD group (p = 0.030) and a positive correlation between ACE activity and Ham-D score (p = 0.047). ANCOVA analysis showed lower Ndel1 activity in BDs compared to HCs. Interestingly, we did not observe between-groups differences in ACE activity, despite the recognized correlation of ACE activity levels with cognitive functions, also described to be worsened in psychiatric patients. Conclusion: Oligopeptidases, especially Ndel1, which has been strongly correlated with neurodevelopment and brain formation, are potentially a good new target in the study of the neurobiology of BD. Limitations: The relatively small sample size did not permit to examine the cause-effect relationship of clinical dimensions of BD and the enzymatic activity. © 2018","ACE; Analysis of Covariance; ANCOVA; Angiotensin I-converting enzyme; angiotensin I-converting enzyme; BD; Bipolar disorder; bipolar disorder; BK; BMI; body mass index; bradykinin; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition; DISC1; Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1; DSM-IV; Enzyme activity; FEP; first episode psychosis; Fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRET; GAF; Global Assessment of Functioning; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; HCs; HDRS; healthy controls; Ndel1; Ndel1; neurotensin; NT; Nuclear distribution element-like 1; Oligopeptidases; schizophrenia; SCID-I; SCZ; SD; SPSS; standard deviation; Statistical Package for Social Sciences; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Axis I; YMRS; Young Mania Rating Scale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054695900

It is a fact that the temperature difference is reasonably large between the top and bottom of a DWC, which typically produces at least a single side product. This may lead to a very large compression ratio (CR), with which, the operation of VRC in the DWC becomes quite complicated and may not be economically so attractive. To improve this situation, the vapor recompression mechanism is further proposed between the side stream and reboiler drum of the DWC column. Utilizing the latent heat of a vapor stream from an intermediate tray in liquid reboiling of the stripper, this side vapor recompressed DWC (SVR-DWC) configuration can reduce the utility consumption and thus improves its energetic and economic potential substantially.

However, the task of engineering the optical excitation with tunable feature in doped luminescent materials has been met with limited success, owing to the limited space for modifying dopant-host interactions. Here, we present an effective strategy for control of the light-harvesting process, based on the collaborative nitriding and annealing in amorphous TiO2:Eu. The structural characterizations, including X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), indicate that the phase of nitrided TiO2:Eu can be well kept in amorphous form below 500 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms that the N content can be well controlled by changing the annealing temperature. The samples present notable absorption in the broad waveband region from 400 to 1000 nm, which is associated with the band tail states induced by nitriding. The doping engineering allows us to achieve broadband and tunable excitation covering the whole ultraviolet waveband from 250 to 400 nm.

Moreover, it was shown that the emitted colour can be tuned by varying the Eu3+ doping level and/or the excitation wavelength. After the analysis of nGCs luminescent features, the energy transfer and metal-metal charge transfer mechanisms, responsible of these emissions, are proposed.

Thus, fabrication of novel materials and structures for this purpose is one of the important challenges of our times. In this study, Ni-Co nanocones as new structure was fabricated by electrodeposition method in the bath containing crystal modifier and electrocatalytic activity of these structures for HER was studied in 1.0 M KOH solution. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) method and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used for physical characterization. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Chronopotentiometry were used for electrocatalytic activity evaluations. Fabricated Ni-Co alloy nanocones exhibited an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for HER. Best electrocatalytic activity was obtained for alloy prepared at Ni/Co salts ratio of about 8, in which η10 = −107 mV, η20 = −142 mV and η100 = −198 mV. This remarkable activity is mainly attributed to the high surface area of the nanocones and also synergistic effect between Ni and Co while decreasing the bubble resistance as a result of fabrication of nanocones. Additionally, the Ni-Co alloy catalyst displayed good durability and affords long-term electrolysis without activity degradation. This study offers a facile fabrication method for in situ growth of 3-D electrocatalyst and also provide deep insight into the relationship between active surface area, intrinsic catalytic activity and catalytic properties. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Electrocatalysis; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Nanocones structure; Renewable energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054346993

The adsorption/dissociation mechanism of H2S and the diffusion behavior of H atoms were calculated by first-principles spin-polarization density functional theory (DFT) on defect-free and vacancy-defective Fe(1 0 0) surfaces. The results show that the maximum dissociation energy barriers of H2S on the Fe(1 0 0) surface of defect-free and first-layer vacancy-defective Fe are 0.35 and 0.17 eV, respectively, indicating that the reactivity of the vacancy-defective Fe(1 0 0) surface is moderately increased. The existence of vacancy defects changes the preferential H atom diffusion entrance to the subsurface and shortens the diffusion path. For H diffusion in bulk Fe(1 0 0), it is found that H atoms diffuse via a tortuous path from one tetrahedral-site to a neighboring tetrahedral-site rather than diffusing through a linear trajectory. Moreover, the previously suggested path via the octahedral site is excluded due to its higher barrier and the rank of the saddle point. Diffusion barriers computed for H atom penetration from the surface into the inner-layers are approximately 0.54 eV (except for second-layer vacancy defects), which are all greater than the activation energy for dissociation of H2S on the Fe(1 0 0) surfaces. This suggests that H diffusion is more probable than H2S dissociation as the rate-limiting step for hydrogen permeation into the bulk Fe(1 0 0). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Density functional theory (DFT) calculations; Diffusion path; Dissociation energy barrier; Fe(1 0 0); Vacancy defects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054195116

The approach first converts the arrival and departure times to time window constraints in order to relax the given timetable. Then a train trajectory optimization method is developed to find optimal arrival/departure times and optimal energy-efficient speed profiles within the relaxed time windows. The proposed train trajectory optimization method includes two types, a single-train trajectory optimization (STTO), which focuses on optimizing individual train movements within the relaxed arrival and departure time windows, and a multi-train trajectory optimization (MTTO), which computes multi-train trajectories simultaneously with a shared objective of minimizing multi-train energy consumption and an additional target of eliminating conflicts between trains. The STTO and MTTO are re-formulated as a multiple-phase optimal control problem, which has the advantage of accurately incorporating varying gradients, curves and speed limits and different train routes. The multiple-phase optimal control problem is then solved by a pseudospectral method. The proposed approach is applied in case studies to fine-tune two timetables, for a single-track railway corridor and a double-track corridor of the Dutch railway.

The experimental setup and the test protocol are tested employing two different bimorph-type harvesters identified as Model A and B. 20 harvesters corresponding to Model A and 10 to Model B are tested multiples times under the test protocol proposed. Results clearly indicate that the most important source of uncertainties deals with the variability of the electromechanical properties of the PEH, which is particularly greater than: (i) the noise on the measurements, (ii) the variations introduced by the clamping condition, and (iii) the dimensional variations in the geometry. The results are also compared with predictions performed by adopting a recent numerical framework to propagate uncertainties in PEHs.

It is shown that nonlinearity and the long-range couplings conspire to the emergence of trains of solitonic structures, when parameters are well chosen within the domain of instability of plane waves. The relevance of the improved model as well as the biological implications of the account of long-range intermolecular interactions, are discussed in the contexts of energy transport and storage in hydrogen-bonded molecular structures in general, and in α-helix proteins in particular. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy; Long-range interaction; Solitons; α-helix",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054067226

In the latter, all possible interaction geometries are taken into account between the species: random, face-to-face, t-shape and edge to edge. In one of these cases, a potential energy curve is gotten when the geometry of interaction is face-to-face using a statistical fit. Focusing in these data distribution, neural networks have been applied on the following cases: i) face-to-face distribution of asphaltene-asphaltene interactions; ii) the complete asphaltene-asphaltene discrete distribution of energy vs contact distance (the minimum distance at which the interacting species is not equal to zero) where all-geometries were used, and iii) the random distribution of geometries of asphaltene-asphaltene interactions. In addition, using an asphaltene model molecule reported by Speight and taking into account two possible asphaltene interactions (face-to-face and random), firstly the data distribution of energy as a function of distance is obtained, and secondly neural networks are applied to fit the corresponding potential energy curve. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Asphaltene-asphaltene system; Neural networks; Potential energy curves",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053805406

In contrast, the reactions of a neutral molecule with a multiply charged ion have rarely been reported, in part because it is difficult to produce such ions in abundance. In this study, we report the production of multiply charged transition metal cations from metallocenes in intense femtosecond laser fields. The most highly charged metals observed at 3 × 1015 W cm−2 are Cr6+, Fe6+, Ni6+, Ru7+, and Os8+. The production of carbon-containing cations originating in cyclopentadienyl ligands is small relative to that of metal cations because the ligands are dominantly liberated as neutral fragments. Metal cations having higher charges are formed by the sequential (stepwise) tunnel ionization of the singly (doubly) charged metal cations that are liberated from the excited metallocene cation (dication). The experimentally measured and theoretically calculated saturation intensities of cation generation are compared. The quasiclassical tunneling theory under a single active electron approximation has been known to underestimate the saturation intensity of singly charged metal cations. However, we investigate that this theory overestimates the saturation intensity of multiply charged metal cations referred to as an enhanced ionization. Moreover, the degree of overestimation becomes significant as the charge number of the metal cation increases. The characteristic deviation of the theoretical predictions from the experimental results is a key issue for the future clarification of the multiple-tunneling ionization processes. We suggest that the polarizabilities depending on the charge number, and presumably the excitation of cations, might be important in the multiple ionization of transition metals. In addition, the production of multiply charged metal cations in abundance, and the reduced production of carbon and hydrocarbon fragment cations achieved by femtosecond laser ionization, will be valuable as sources of multiply charged metal cations for future ion–molecule reaction studies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","ADK theory; Enhanced ionization; Femtosecond laser; Ionization energy; Tunnel ionization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054589166

Most assessments of sustainable agriculture in this region focus on the availability and affordability of resource inputs. However, studies accounting for environmental footprint of agricultural activities in South Asian countries are limited in the existing literature. This paper analyzed the environmental impact of energy utilization in agriculture in India and Pakistan. More specifically, the study analyzes the trends of fuel and electricity consumption for crop production in these countries during a ten-year period between the years 2002 and 2011. Life cycle impact assessment categories including global warming potential, human toxicity, acidification and eutrophication were used to holistically analyze the end-user impact of energy consumption. Results indicated an increase in these impacts for both countries during the study period. On a per hectare basis, the assessed impacts were relatively greater in India than in Pakistan during the study period. The main reason behind larger impacts in India was its significantly greater use of coal for electricity generation. Overall, this study showed that further electrification of agriculture will not necessarily lead to cleaner environment in these countries. Due to high population growth rates, energy consumption for agriculture is expected to grow in these countries in the future. Unless cleaner sources of electricity are used, further energy intensification in agriculture will be detrimental to ecosystem and human health, which in turn will be counterproductive for sustainable agriculture. © 2018","Agriculture; Decade; Energy consumption; Life cycle impact assessment; South Asia",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052466085

By increasing either concentration or velocity, the surface temperature reduces, and the cooling uniformity improves. The velocity has a more significant effect on the temperature in comparison with the effect of concentration. Increasing the velocity and concentration decreases the thermal entropy generation. Moreover, frictional entropy generation intensifies with the increment of concentration and velocity. Besides, the friction has a minor contribution in overall irreversibility of the heat sink compared with heat transfer. In the heat sink, a lower fraction of total entropy is generated in the solid walls, and chief fraction occurs in the fluid. Finally, a decision-making based approach is used for optimization in addition to the three-objective optimization. The optimization is carried out on the models obtained from the neural network to reach minimum values for the surface temperature, pumping power and irreversibility. The optimal cases are reported considering different priorities of the objective functions.

The absorption and emission spectra were characterized using Judd-Ofelt (J-O) theory and radiative parameters viz., radiative transition probability (AR), branching ratio (βR), and luminescence quantum efficiency (η), radiative life time (τ), stimulated emission cross-section (σP E) were evaluated. The values of radiative parameters are found to be the highest for the transition 5D0→7F2 of 0.6mol% Eu3+ doped YABiBS glass (BE0.6). The co-doping of Bi3+ ions (10.0mol %) caused a substantial enhancement (nearly three times) in the intensity of this red emission. These results suggested the energy transfer between Bi3+ ions and Eu3+ ions. The energy transfer efficiency has been explained in terms of structural modifications taking place in the glass network. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bi3+ ions; Energy transfer; Eu3+ ions; Photoluminescence; YABiBS glasses",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053071004

The effect of various operational parameters including feed gas type, gas flow rate, water flow rate and power on removal and energy efficiency has been studied.

While working under optimal conditions, energy consumption was situated in the range 2.42–4.25 kW h/m³ which is about two times lower than the economically viable energy cost of AOPs (5 kW h/m³).

Luminescence is attributed to the host sensitization, though the possibility of metal to metal charge transfer excitation is not ruled out.

In this work, AChE hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine (ATCh) to generate thiocholine (TCh), which can reduce chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) into AuNPs and in situ formation of TCh-BNQDs/AuNPs aggregates, resulting in fluorescence quenching of BNQDs. Moreover, paraoxon, a organophosphorus pesticide, was used to lower the activity of AChE and hinder the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction, hence weakened the fluorescence quenching of BNQDs. Based on these findings, a simple ‘one-pot’ FRET-based biosensor has been constructed to assess AChE activity and its inhibitor by measuring the fluorescence intensity of BNQDs. The linear range toward AChE was from 0.05 to 6.0 mU/mL with the lower detection limit of 0.0212 mU/mL, indicating the biosensor out-performs most of the reported sensors. Since the activity of AChE has been connected to a number of diseases, this convenient ‘mix and detect’ approach has potentially extensive application in clinic diagnosis. On the other hand, the inhibition effect by paraoxon was evaluated, and the corresponding half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) toward AChE was estimated to be 2.987 μg/L.As far as we known, the proposed biosensing platform based on TCh-BNQDs/AuNPs nanocomposites is the first time to demonstrate the application of BNQDs for fluormetric assays of enzyme activity and inhibiting effect.

The quality characteristics of the coating, comprising of Inconel 625 matrix reinforced with tungsten carbide (WC) particles, were optimised as functions of laser energy density, inconel content in the composite coating and shielding gas flow rates. Evidence from this study establishes that laser energy density is the dominant factor which influences all the output responses.

Consequently, dilution ratio was minimised as coating's microhardness and process efficiency were maximised with appropriate combination of laser energy density, inconel content and shielding gas flow rates.

A laser-induced spark was adopted as a pilot source because LSI has potential benefits as compared to conventional electrical spark ignition: no wall effects, no heat-loss to electrodes, etc. Ignition characteristics, therefore, can be investigated without effects of ignition source via LSI. DME-air mixtures filled in a combustion chamber on a framework package were ignited during free-fall. The ignition energy and flame kernel development were investigated with varying the equivalence ratio and the laser pulse energy. The minimum ignition energy (MIE) was calculated statistically via the logistic regression method. Comparing MIE and flame kernel development between normal gravity and microgravity, MIE in microgravity was lower than that in normal gravity over tested equivalence ratios ranging from 0.575 to 0.675. The difference of MIE became significant with decreasing the equivalence ratio, the maximum value of which was 7.0 mJ at the lowest equivalence ratio. Flame kernel was deformed in normal gravity due to buoyant force. The flame kernel in the bottom region was often not able to develop against buoyant force. Ignition succeeded consequently when only the top of flame kernel developed into a self-sustaining flame to propagate throughout the entire chamber. This flame deformation was noticeable as the equivalence ratio decreased because the flame propagation speed also decreased. On the other hand, in microgravity, reduced buoyant force allowed the flame kernel to stably develop into a self-sustaining flame. This is the first time that both MIE and flame kernel development via LSI were found experimentally to be well affected by gravity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dimethyl ether (DME); Flame kernel development; Laser-induced spark ignition; Microgravity; Minimum ignition energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054094833

In this review, we aim to assess the advantages/disadvantages of porous materials via summarizing the key research progress on the porous materials (e.g., metal foams, expanded graphite, graphene aerogels, carbon nanotubes, porous minerals, mesoporous silica, etc.) as ss-PCMs supports. The effects of pore size and geometry, surface modification, interaction forces, compositions, etc. on the phase change behaviors of ss-PCMs are summarized and discussed in detail by comparing the different porous materials. We believe that the summary and discussion in the review will lead to a better understanding on the designing and constructing of efficient ss-PCMs, and even shed light on the design for novel porous materials supported ss-PCMs based on the discovered interactions between the porous supports and PCMs. Finally, the future research topics and challenges on porous materials for ss-PCMs development are also prospected with emphasizing on the emergence of new design of porous materials with improved thermal conductivity, high PCMs loading amount and high thermal latent for practical applications. © 2018","Porous supports; Shape-stabilized composite PCMs; Thermal energy storage and applications",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053291160

In particular, academics' and practitioners' expectations have resulted in notable initiatives that incorporate sustainability assessment in managerial decision-making. The sustainability paradigm investigates practices and policies that simultaneously account for economic, environmental, and social aspects. Drawing on the perspective of a sustainability-conscious decision maker, this paper centers on the evaluation of logistical locations with capacitated production levels through a two-phase assessment procedure. To design a supervisory framework to measure the sustainability performance of the supplying facilities under investigation, we develop a double bootstrap data envelopment analysis model with undesirable factors in the first phase. We, then, use the obtained bias-corrected efficiency estimates in the second phase to establish sustainability-based policies in the context of facility location problems. The proposed model is applied to an energy case study of fossil fuel power plants in the United States. We present empirical evidence corroborating a considerable difference between the results of the case where the decision maker explores the environmental and social impacts of the power plants and the conventional formulation by which only financial outcomes are considered. Our numerical findings reveal that the proposed approach substantially diminishes greenhouse gas emissions at the cost of slight increases in total expenses. In addition to such an improvement in the environmental efficiency, we provide evidence of a dramatic enhancement in the social performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Capacitated facility location problem; Double bootstrap data envelopment analysis; Energy sector; Sustainability performance measurement",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054174992

Therefore, it is of great importance to perform fault detection on the insulation system. In this paper, a Modified Extended Kalman Filter (M-EKF) fault detection strategy based on the electrical parametric model derived from the RLC network modeling of Roebel bars is proposed. The proposed fault detection strategy mainly includes two parts. The first step is to establish reasonable state space equations for the model structure extracted to monitor the state of the insulation system. In the second step, the conventional continuous EKF is modified to follow more accurately the state of the marine current turbine.

The topological parameters of this hydrogen bond obtained due to the calculations in the framework of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and the Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) index method allow us to assess the energy of the С‒Н···N interaction as 1–2 kcal mol−1 and assign it to the category of a weak hydrogen bond having predominantly electrostatic nature. One of the spectral features of this H-bond formation is an increase in the one-bond 13С‒1Н coupling constants across the Сα‒Нα bond relative to that of other aryl- and hetaryl vinyl ethers. Quantum-chemical calculations within the DFT framework with different functionals and basis sets show that this coupling constant increases on going from the syn-conformation to the anti-conformation of 2-vinyloxypyroidine due to H-bonding in the former conformation. Accounting for the solvent effect within the framework of the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) in the calculations makes it possible to give a quantitative theoretical estimate of the contribution from the hydrogen bonding to the one-bond 13С‒1Н coupling constants as 5–6 Hz that is in very good agreement with the empirical assessment.

The distributed system is sized based on the physical limitations of the site and the effect on the net demand is calculated. As expected, solar and wind energy are generally decoupled. The solar energy presents a more predictable daily and seasonal trend; the wind system introduces a high variability on the net demand.

Thus, it is possible to find the conditions in which the project would be viable and evaluate the needed economic policies and/or technical improvements to move in that direction.

This paper is to introduce a waste disposal technology referring to the integrated treatment of MSW and SS. Four scenarios were analyzed including Mono-incineration of MSW (Case 1) and SS (Case 2), co-incineration of SS and MSW by traditional (Case 3) and integrated ways (Case 4), in terms of environment, energy and economic impact by means of LCA, CED and TEA method.

The present work analyzes the removal of persistent perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA, 204 mg L−1) from industrial process waters using a strategy that combines membrane pre-concentration followed by electrooxidation of the concentrate. A mathematical model describing the nanofiltration (NF) system was developed and complemented with new and background experimental data of PFHxA and ion species rejections and total permeate flux through the NF270 and NF90 membranes. Similarly, the kinetics of PFHxA electrolysis on boron doped diamond anodes was determined at laboratory scale. Later, the model was used to simulate the NF-ELOX integrated process, where a commercial spiral wound unit (membrane area 7.6 m2) was implemented and the electrooxidation unit was scaled-up to pilot plant (anode area 1.05 m2). The obtained energy savings depended on a combination of the target PFHxA removal ratio at the end of the treatment train, the separation performance of the commercial membrane and the reduction of the electrolyte ohmic resistance in the electrooxidation stage, that was attained as a result of the increase of salts content in the concentrate. Only the tight NF90 membrane allowed to achieve high (99%) PFHxA removal ratios in the integrated NF-ELOX process, and the specific energy consumption was estimated at 11.6 kWh m−3, 59.2% less than when electrolysis alone was applied. Still, the electrolysis is the most energy demanding step, with 85.9% contribution to the total energy consumption. The strategy of combining membrane pre-concentration with electrochemical degradation could be extended to the treatment of other highly persistent organic compounds. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","BDD electrolysis; Energy minimization; Nanofiltration; Perfluorohexanoic acid; Process integration",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044529423

Due to the presence of multiple localised states, a new method to switch from periodic to quasi-periodic states is proposed. The algorithm is applied to two different minimal models for bladed disks vibrating in large amplitudes regimes. In the first case, each sector of the bladed disk is modelled by a single degree of freedom, while in the second application a second degree of freedom is included to account for the disk inertia.

However, it is extremely difficult to achieve broadband energy absorption with single resonance based EMMs. Dissipative EMMs with multiple resonators have recently been suggested for the attenuation of elastic wave energy spanning broad frequency spectrums. In this study, we fabricate a dissipative EMM with multiple resonators comprised from layered spherical inclusions embedded in an epoxy matrix and experimentally demonstrate broadband elastic wave mitigation. An analytical solution combined with numerical simulations is used to validate the accuracy of the fabrication based on a single unit cell test. We also numerically investigate the dynamic wave dispersion behavior of the fabricated dissipative EMM and find that the two strong attenuation regions induced by the two internal resonators can be effectively combined into a broadband wave attenuation region by the intrinsic damping properties of the constitutive materials used in the design. This broadband wave attenuation is finally demonstrated through an impact test performed on finite EMM samples where the frequency spectrum of the transmitted amplitude is in very good agreement with the numerical results. This design can be easily scaled and implemented into different length scales, which will benefit a range of applications requiring broadband vibration, elastic wave, and/or seismic wave mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Broadband energy attenuation; Dissipative elastic metamaterials; Microstructural design",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054576759

The estimated FEP directly reveals the presence of strongly nonlinear modal interactions, in the form of non-smooth perturbations (spikes) that result from transient resonance captures between different harmonic components of the measured data.

Five parallel circular tubes subjected to different modes of the falling film were tested for formation of ice after being fed internally by cold ethylene-glycol solution.

Magnesium silicide (Mg2Si) can be a good hydrolysis candidate due to its low cost and ability of releasing hydrogen gas during hydrolysis process. However, previous studies have demonstrated that Mg2Si could easily produce large amount of silanes during hydrolysis reaction, which may cause serious problem of explosive danger when in contact with air. Here it is the first time that Mg2Si was used for generation of hydrogen by a simple and convenient one-step hydrolysis reaction. In this study, hydrolysis kinetics and mechanisms of Mg2Si in NH4Cl and NH4F solutions were investigated. The silanes could be almost completely turned into hydrogen by introduction of fluorine ion during the hydrolysis reaction of Mg2Si, leading to very low silanes content in the produced hydrogen. The kinetic studies indicated that when the concentration of the NH4F solution increased to 13.0%, the hydrogen generation rate and the reaction yield were improved significantly and reached the best performance, producing 466 mL g−1 H2 in 10 min and 616 mL g−1 H2 in 30 min at 25 °C. The activation energy was calculated to be 37.3 ± 0.8 kJ mol−1. Furthermore, the hydrogen yield and the hydrolysis rate of Mg2Si can be further improved by high-energy ball milling. After ball milling for 2 and 5 h, the hydrogen generation yield in 30 min increased to 698 and 771 mL g−1, respectively, and the activation energy was decreased to 23.9 ± 0.6 kJ mol−1 and 12.9 ± 0.1 kJ mol−1, respectively.

This paper is devoted to study the influence of Gamma irradiation on the morphology, optical, and dielectric properties of AZ nanostructured thin films. Nanostructure powder of Alizarin is synthesized according to chemical routes. Subsequently, thin films of AZ are fabricated via thermal evaporator. The bared thin film is irradiated at different doses of 60Co γ-rays. Furthermore, the bared and irradiated films are characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM) and UV–Vis-NIR spectroscopy. XRD investigations reveal that the bared film has a nanostructure and the average particle size increases gradually as the γ-irradiation dose increases. AFM images show remarkable increment in the surface roughness of the irradiated film over the bared one. In the light of structure induced changes, clear variations in the optical properties are addressed. Of these, the energy gap decreases gradually as the irradiation dose increases. The film irradiated at 45 kGy shows the highest optical conductivity.

This problem is seen as a major obstacle to the expansion of renewable energy if it is not handled in a suitable way. Efficient electricity storage technology is one of the feasible solutions. The current study proposes Fe3O4/water nanofluid under magnetic field as the secondary fluid in the proposed double pipe heat exchanger before the cavern. The heat of compressed air is absorbed by the secondary fluid and it is stored in an isolation tank. This stored fluid is used to warm up the air that leaves the cavern for expanding in the turbine. The results demonstrated that increasing the mass flow rate of secondary fluid decreases the cavern temperature. Also, the value of convective heat transfer of ferrofluid increases when the volume fraction of nanoparticle as well as magnetic field increases. Furthermore, increasing the volume fraction and magnetic field increases the pressure drop and friction factor of ferrofluid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed air energy storage; Fe3O4 nanoparticles; Ferrofluid; Magnetic field; Transient response",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054177556

This enables a manageable smoother power output to the grid, more suitable for trading. The system consists of two storage tanks for accumulating a liquid solution at two different pressures, connected with a compressor and an expander of the vapor absorbed/desorbed. An additional heat exchanger allows for recovering the absorption heat from the high-pressure tank seeking for storage efficiency.

This paper mainly investigated the possibility of utilizing wastewater heat to reduce ventilation heat load. Swedish residential buildings are to a significant extent served by mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) systems. MVHR in airtight buildings has greatly reduced ventilation heat loads, especially in cold climate countries such as Sweden. However, cold outdoor air might lead to frost formation in heat recovery exchangers which increases the energy use. Therefore, this study focused on reducing the defrosting need by preheating the incoming cold outdoor air to MVHR during the coldest days. The effects of preheating the incoming air to MVHR on ventilation heat load and annual ventilation heating demand were also studied. It was found that the heat recovery efficiency of MVHR is the most decisive factor in rating the performance of the combined system with an air preheater. Contributions of the studied air preheater to annual energy savings were negligible. On the other hand, the reduction of the initial defrosting need was significant. The obtained results showed that the defrosting need in a building located in central Sweden in two cases of an MVHR system equipped with a rotary heat exchanger/plate heat exchanger was eliminated/reduced to one-third.

To ensure environmental and energy sustainability, the use of ATES is governed by strict regulations, one of which is the requirement of maintaining a balance in the amount of heat transfer into the ground. In general, the combination of a heat pump (HP) and an air handling unit (AHU) are commonly used to achieve this thermal balance through regeneration strategies for cooling dominated loads. However, this approach increases the operational cost and energy consumption of ATES heating/cooling systems. In this paper, an alternative approach that makes use of night ventilation (NV) for regeneration is evaluated. In addition, the operational cost and energy efficiencies of the commonly used combination of an HP and AHU are compared to those associated with NV operation.

Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building regulations; buildings; energy demand; energy efficiency; energy policy; governance; India; local authorities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053548913

High density (~99.1%) and finer grain size (~3.4 µm) have been obtained for the Al2O3 ceramics at an optimum dopant concentration of 5000 ppm SrO (AS5) attributed to the important effects of in-situ formed strontium hexaluminates (SrAl12O19). Controlled grain growth behaviour in SrO doped Al2O3 (AS5) may be ascribed to the zener pinning stresses and solute drag effect actuated by the grain boundary phase SrAl12O19 with platelet morphology. Improved densification behaviour in SrO doped Al2O3 (AS5), presumably because of the lower interfacial energy of newly formed Al2O3/SrAl12O19 interfaces and key benefits of secondary phase (SrAl12O19) inhibited grain growth mechanism. The activation energy for densification in SrO doped Al2O3 (AS5) is found to be 550 ± 30 kJ/mol, which is higher compared to undoped Al2O3 and the estimated activation energies have been phenomenonlogically correlated to the lower energy of Al2O3/SrAl12O19 interfaces.

A better understanding of this demand can help to develop effective energy-efficiency policies, optimize the addition of generation capacity, and tackle challenges of climate change and environmental pollution. However, research on residential electricity consumption has received limited attention in India until now. A systematic examination of determinants of residential electricity consumption will require an interdisciplinary approach involving the fields of engineering, economics (traditional and behavioural), anthropology, architecture and others. A two-step approach is presented to advance understanding. First, a critical literature review from different disciplines is presented that explores residential electricity consumption in India.

This paper assesses the life cycle costs (LCC), life cycle energy (LCE) and CO2 emissions impacts of filling the current housing gap with different building materials and technologies, and maintaining reasonable standards of indoor temperature and humidity. These outcomes are assessed under different climatic conditions and residential behavioural patterns, using urban and rural housing archetypes, and considering conventional as well as low-cost materials and energy-savings measures. The results demonstrate that stabilized-earth blocks are a preferred solution to the prevailing norm of fired bricks. Along with filler slab and roof insulation, they offer a win–win solution to reduce both LCC by 18% and LCE by 17% compared with conventional techniques in bridging the housing gap. LCE savings can be further increased to 28% without increasing the investment cost compared with conventional solutions.

This study examines the reasons for declining FDI inflows to Pakistan, considering the main issues, such as terrorism, energy shortages, financial instability, and political instability, with some macroeconomic indicators as control variables. These analyses are based on pre- and post-global financial crisis events, and we check the robustness by controlling for the global financial crisis. Our analyses are conducted using an autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) for co-integration among variables. The results show that energy shortages, financial instability, and political instability have adverse effects, and terrorism has insignificant effects on FDI inflows to Pakistan before the financial crisis in the long term. However, the post-financial crisis period indicates that terrorism and energy shortages are the main drivers of decline in FDI inflows to Pakistan. Market size, inflation, and exchange rates affect FDI inflows positively. The global financial crisis has an adverse impact on FDI inflows to Pakistan.

This paper provides a quantitative model-based assessment of the evolution of India’s building sector in terms of both energy systems transition and its macroeconomic implications. The coupling of a bottom-up technology-rich energy system model with a macroeconomic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model provides an innovative approach for the in-depth robust analysis of the energy transition in India’s building stock and the induced macroeconomic and employment impacts on the Indian economy. Two main scenarios are explored, namely: the business-as-usual (BAU) and the advanced nationally determined contribution (Adv. NDC) scenarios. The investigation shows that efficiency improvements are vital to counteract the upward pressure on energy demand in the building sector. Energy demand in the building sector results in an increase of CO2 emissions by 27% between 2015 and 2030 due to the technology transition from inefficient solid fuels (traditional biomass) to cleaner energy (liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), piped natural gas (PNG)) before shifting to electricity. The Adv. NDC scenario also leads to a shift in employment from agriculture and towards sectors that benefit from the implementation of Adv. NDC, especially in the construction sectors, electricity and manufacturing sectors. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building stock; computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; energy demand; energy system model; India; macroeconomic assessment; nationally determined contribution (NDC); technology transitions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054328369

This paper undertakes an exploratory investigation to develop and test a customized building performance evaluation (BPE) approach (I-BPE framework) for the Indian context. As academia is considered to be an initial primary outlet of BPE, a survey of experts is conducted to investigate the drivers and barriers for implementing BPE-based methods in educational curricula. The I-BPE approach is tested in a case study building to gain insights for refining the underlying methods and processes for conducting further BPE studies in the context of India. The expert survey reveals the lack of trained people for teaching BPE as a key challenge to its adoption, implying that trained people are needed as much as frameworks. To enable widespread adoption of I-BPE in India, what will be necessary is a new cadre of building performance evaluators who can be trained (or up-skilled) through formal or continuing education. This will need to be driven by both policy (energy code) and market transformation (‘green’ rating systems).

Presently, the technology of producing nanosized particles is evolving, and their application in various aspects of pavement engineering is becoming more cost-effective. Nanosilica, due to its spherical shape, high specific area, very tiny size and higher density compared to bitumen, presents an inherent potential to accelerate molecular randomisation movements, promote bitumen binder flow into microcracks and evolve healing index (HI) of hot mix asphalt (HMA). Moreover, it has been proved that Styrene–Butadiene–Styrene polymer (SBS) promotes fatigue life of HMA and decreases its temperature sensitivity. It would be interesting to know if the addition of nanosilica to modified binder with SBS will promote the total HI and lead to an enhanced HMA life cycle. In this study, the effects of four parameters, most importantly, the effect of the combination of nanosilica particles and SBS polymer to improve the self-healing of asphalt mixture was investigated using the Taguchi design of experiment (DOE) method. Experiments performed with the Superpave indirect tensile test included repeated loadings (fracture) and healing phases. These experiments showed that the combination of nanosilica and SBS promoted the self-healing of HMA, significantly. Moreover, the optimum condition to attain maximum HI and effect factor of each parameter, based on Taguchi DOE method, was obtained. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope images of fatigued, under healing and healed HMA samples were captured to investigate HMA self-healing mechanism. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dissipated creep strain energy; healing index; healing index; Nanosilica; styrene–butadiene–styrene; Taguchi DOE method",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006852897

The chapter examines the emergence, varying interpretations and the salient aspects of energy security. Sustainable energy and its characteristics are also identified. The two notions of energy security and sustainable energy are different, but there is an intrinsic relationship between them. In order to achieve the objectives of both energy security and energy sustainability together, the concept of sustainable energy security (SES) is proposed. ‘Sustainable energy security’ (SES) is defined as ‘provisioning of uninterrupted energy services (short term and long term) in an affordable, equitable, efficient and environmentally benign manner’. The conceptualization of SES goes beyond sustainable and secure energy ‘sources’ and implies a sustainable and a secure energy ‘system’. Hence, SES is contextualized in an energy system framework and the concept of ‘sustainability’ and ‘security’ is applied to the entire ‘energy system’. This perspective accommodates the supply side, the demand side and the three dimensions of sustainable development, viz. social, economic and environmental, in its approach. The characteristics, importance and competing dimensions of SES are also highlighted. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Energy security; Energy system; Sustainable energy; Sustainable energy security",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051228193

The addition of Li2CO3 flux (5 wt%) improved the purity of the resultant phosphors and increased their emission intensity. An intense, broad excitation band in the range of 200–400 nm with a peak at 358 nm was recorded, which suits the needs of UV LED chips. Under this excitation wavelength, intense blue emission, which peaked at 439 nm, was recorded in the Ce3+ single-doped phosphors, while two distinct luminescence bands were observed in the Ce3+/Tb3+ co–doped Y5Si3O12N phosphors: a blue one, which peaked at 439 nm and is ascribed to Ce3+ ions, and an efficient green one, which peaked at 549 nm and is assigned to 5D4→7F5 transitions in Tb3+ ions. A high luminescence quantum yield, of 85%, was achieved.

The impacts of a sustainable campus policy by University are essential for remaining competitive and productive internationally while meeting the UN SDGs.

Therefore, this study tries to find out a possible economic quantification of energy activities performed by the universities and to test the proposed over the Polytechnic University of Catalunia (UPC) via a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and an impact assessment analysis. This study provided valuable information about the economic impact of such activities on the local economy, enhancing the role of the university as source of social and economic growth. Indeed, despite the relative low percentage of investments with respect to the total annual budget, the repercussion in terms of employment, output and GDP have been important in the case of UPC. Moreover, it can be said that the induced effects of such initiatives are much more impacting than the investments themselves.

The results indicated that the annual cumulative cooling load was far greater than the annual cumulative heat load, so it has great potential for heat recovery. Then a system that made use of waste heat from data rooms to serve subsidiary buildings was proposed. It could fully satisfy the heat demand in data centers when equipment in data rooms all run.

However, one of the major disadvantages is that it is very time-consuming and computational-intensive for large scale whole-core simulations, especially for coupling with depletion analysis for realistic reactors. Some recent researches indicate that one of the principle performance bottlenecks for the problem lies in the energy lookup algorithm during the calculation of energy-dependent material cross sections. Therefore, two physics-oriented optimization strategies, based on making use of the physical characteristics of neutron transport behaviors, are developed to optimize the run-time performance of the algorithm for accelerating the energy lookup without any loss in precision and accuracy. The first optimization strategy is called Neighbored Material Cascade Grid (NMCG) which is a hybrid approach utilizing the key features of the cascade grid and double indexing method. The second optimization strategy is called Adaptive Optimal Logarithmic Grid (AOLG) which is a variation of the conventional logarithmic energy grid method utilizing the advantages of energy hash tables. The strategies are incorporated into a continuous energy Monte Carlo neutron transport code and tested on realistic whole-core reactor systems. The computational performance as measured by memory usage, elapsed runtime and overall speedup, associated with each of the optimization strategies are demonstrated in the whole-core Monte Carlo simulations.

Therefore, this paper seeks to provide a theoretical foundation by comparing the metric with alternative cost of energy metrics and by undertaking a brief literature review to describe its strengths and weaknesses. In comparison with other potential measures of unit cost of energy, LCOE is found to be the preferred choice, in large part because of its widespread adoption. The weaknesses of the LCOE are found to centre on discount rate, inflation effects and the sensitivity of results to uncertainty in future commodity costs. These weaknesses are explored in the context of comparing combined cycle gas fired generation and offshore wind in the UK, based on publicly available cost measures. It is found that with variability of future fuel gas prices, and a Monte Carlo approach to modelling LCOE, the range of LCOE for CCGT is much broader in comparison to the LCOE of offshore wind. It is urged that explicit account be taken of the areas of weakness in future use of LCOE. © 2018 The Authors","Levelised cost of energy; Monte Carlo; Offshore wind energy; Uncertainty",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054977184

Outage projects have to manage a set of events of various natures: technical, organizational or human hazards and changes in regulation. Obviously, the Socio-Organizational and Human (SOH) dimensions are essential to overtake these difficulties, and to reach and maintain the performance of the outage projects at an acceptable cost (human, social, financial). For several years, the outage projects did not reach the expected performance. Concluding that the organization would have reached its limits, the operator launched a 3 years R&D project in 2015. This project aimed at enlightening the mechanisms and SOH characteristics that contribute to reach and maintain the targeted performance. First, the R&D project developed an “effective organization” model for an outage. Second, an approach were designed to perform a diagnosis of the organization, using the model as a framework for analysis. This paper first describes the approach and the main lessons learnt from the field studies, focusing on collective creativity that is needed to manage hazard events even in a highly regulated and constrained domain. Then, the paper will present lessons from applying the approach to a production plant.

One of its aims is to transform its territory into a model region for energy efficiency and renewable energy. To support a well-informed decision making process, this study provides the first insight about the status quo of energy balances in EUSALP, at local as well as aggregated level. Moreover, it offers an overview on the various energy targets defined by the territorial units that constitute the EUSALP region. Data has been retrieved via a bottom-up quality-oriented process consisting of (i) a survey targeted at responsible person in local energy departments; and (ii) data control and harmonization.

Uncertainties in the load growth and the solar PV generation are considered in the assessment of risk by using modified risk-adjusted cost ratios. Furthermore, the size and allocation of BESS in the network system are optimized by applying a heuristic algorithm.

Initially, a resource that can supply geothermal water at 180 °C at a rate of 100 kg/s is considered. Power generated from the geothermal plant during off-peak hours is used to produce and store liquefied air. This liquefied air is used to generate power during peak hours using the heat of geothermal water. Our analysis indicates that the liquefaction unit consumes 4304 kW power in order to liquefy air for a 6-h charging period. In the discharge mode, the CES unit can produce a net power output of 12,049 kW for a 1-h operation. The flashing pressure is optimized at 255 kPa for which the total power output is 16,100 kW.

Here a framework is presented for understanding energy efficiency investment decisions drawing on methods from behavioral decision research. The approach begins with a normative analysis that characterizes how building owners should behave, compares this to interview and survey data from decision-makers, then concludes with policy recommendations suggesting how to bridge that gap. The framework is demonstrated with a sample of class B and C office building owners in Pittsburgh, a population believed to under-invest in energy efficiency. Interviews (n = 16) and a survey (n = 132) found that while uncertainty and a lack of information about costs and energy savings play a critical role in decision-making, a significant proportion of the respondents also express aversion to debt and a lack of sensitivity to split incentives. Based on the results, providing owners of class B and C offices cost–benefit information and resolving energy savings uncertainty through guarantees, trial periods, or grants that fully subsidize energy efficiency for a small part of a building may be a way to enhance investment.

Deficiencies and errors made during construction and operation led to environmental pollution, resulting to the strong reactions of the residents.

Physiological model comprises a number of equations to relate biomedical signals. Each equation contains a set of coefficients. Determining the coefficients is a complex task as the models are non-linear. Therefore, development of the models must be accompanied by a development of methods to determine model coefficients. With the advent of wearable medical devices, we have to consider energy requirements of the models and the methods. Considering an illustrative case of type-1 diabetes mellitus patients, we already demonstrated that Meta-Differential Evolution outperforms analytical methods, when determining coefficients of glucose dynamics. In this paper, we analyze convergence of the Meta-Differential Evolution, running time and associated power consumption on a single board computer with a system-on-a-chip—Cortex-A8 AM335x. Based on the analysis, we recommend splitting the process of determining the coefficients into two phases. First phase determines the initial, per-patient optimized coefficients. Second phase is an energetically efficient update of these coefficients with new, continuously measured signal of the patient. Meta-Differential Evolution searches for optimal coefficients by evolving a number of generations of candidate coefficients, using a number of evolutionary strategies. We demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of candidate coefficients to evaluate, while achieving the desired accuracy. This positively reflects in the lifetime of wearable device’s battery. Specifically, calculating coefficient’s update took 0.05 Ws only.

The expectation from this support function is to make decisions more well founded and thus of higher quality. The paper describes a selection of cases in which consequences from the wider HTO perspective has been evident, comprising benefits as well as some identified pitfalls that can serve as relevant experiences for readers interested in pursuing similar endeavors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Energy sector; Human-Technology-Organization; Nuclear; Strategy",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051724452

The data provided through closed- and open-ended questions suggest, from the perspective of those hosting energy infrastructure on farms and ranches, oil and gas development has enhanced agriculture operations and rural livelihoods but is not without negative impacts or tradeoffs. We introduce the balancing act as a useful framework for considering tradeoffs associated with hosting extractive industries as it allows space for the “balance” between economic activities to be impossible, aspirational or achievable.

Scheduling allows the platform to improve the performance of WSN. Scheduling the sensor nodes and category of sensor data minimizes the energy consumption and increases the lifetime of sensor nodes. This chapter describes the concept of optimization techniques in WSNs to extend performance. We surveyed four metaheuristic optimization approaches to enhance the scheduling performance because these approaches help to find optimal solutions quickly. Optimizing the sensor node placement through scheduling of sensor and sensor data allows a better quality of service (QoS) in WSN.

The aggregates are united by a common resource collector and have different technical characteristics (performance and efficiency). The characteristics of the aggregates are given in tabular form for a limited number of operating modes. Such schemes allow to increase the productivity of the process, to save energy and to ensure the reliability of the system. As a function of the goal, the total consumption of energy consumed or the efficiency of the system is used. The description of the method of direct search of variants, the use of the genetic algorithm, the search algorithm by moving along the extremal is given. The search for a solution using a genetic algorithm requires much less computational cost than direct busting. The genetic algorithm, as a rule, gives an approximate solution. The motion search along the extremal allows to obtain a solution with a minimal number of iterations. A variant of the solution of the problem is proposed with variable productivity of the units. In this case, for each capacity value, the minimum number of operating units is determined, which ensures optimal load distribution. The transition from one to another performance value of a group of units is carried out with a minimum number of inclusions or shutdowns. On the basis of the considered algorithms, the software for the automated dispatch control system of the heat and power complex was developed. The use of optimal algorithms for gas boiler houses provides gas savings of up to 5% compared to traditional dispatch control. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Energy; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Parallel units; Simulation",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054699880

The present work aimed to characterize the oil chemical composition in eleven different accessions of domestic and wild cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L. var. altilis and var. sylvestris, respectively) in order to evaluate its putative use as an alternative energy crop, with main focus in biodiesel production. No significant differences were measured between both botanical varieties for oil content; values of 20.80 ± 6.65% were found. The highest values were observed for the wild cardoon accessions “Uruguay Centro” (35.95%) and “Pergamino” (27.78%). The fatty acid composition was similar for both botanical varieties: palmitic (10.9%), stearic (3.0%), oleic (23.5%) and linoleic (61.3%). Comparing with traditional energy crops (soybean, sunflower and rapeseed) the cardoon fatty acid profile is similar to those obtained for soybean. Several biodiesel quality parameters were calculated or estimated over different oil samples. In this way, the acidity ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 mg OH/goil, showing differences among accessions but not between botanical varieties. “Cardo Blanco Peralta” and A-41 (cultivated cardoon) presented the lowest unsaturated degree, iodine values and oleic/linoleic acid relation in their oil; consequently, they showed the most suitable values for the biodiesel quality parameters (cetane number and kinetic viscosity). Based on seed oil composition, this characterization, allowed demonstrating that cardoon oil has appropriate characteristics to be used as feedstock for the production of biodiesel, as well as, to detect accessions with superior quality properties. © 2018","Biodiesel; Cardoon; Energy crop; Fatty acid; Oil",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052867384

This study aims (a) to portray the works that have focused on the acceptance of HET, (b) to highlight the limits of acceptance-based approaches, (c) to point out the benefits of adopting a Needs’ anticipation approach rather than an acceptance-based approach in human technology relationship issues, (d) to attest its relevance in the context of HET and (e) to propose a Needs’ anticipation approach related to a need seeker innovation strategy.

Motivating occupants to change their behaviour can become a challenging task, especially if they are expected to internalize and adopt the new behaviour on a long term.

Methods: Indirect calorimetry was performed in nursing home residents to estimate their basal metabolism. The basal metabolism was multiplied by a physical activity level coefficient and energy expenditure that was related to thermogenesis (i.e., 10% of the total amount of energy ingested over 24 h) was added. In this way, we obtained the total energy expenditure of each nursing home resident. The nutritional intake of each resident was calculated using the precise food-weighing method over a 3-d period. The difference between energy expenditure and consumption was calculated for each patient and the mean of the difference in the population was calculated. These quantitative variables were compared by means of analysis of variance. Results: A total of 25 subjects were included in this study (88.1 ± 5.8 y; 84% women). The estimated mean basal metabolism was 1087.2 ± 163.2 kcal. The physical activity level was 1.29 ± 0.1 on average and the energy expenditure due to thermogenesis was 163.1 ± 28.9 kcal. Thus, the mean daily energy expenditure was 1575.2 ± 210.6 kcal, which was within the range of the actual calculated energy intake of the residents (1631.5 ± 289.3 kcal; P = 0.33). Conclusions: The estimated energy intake of Belgian nursing home residents seems appropriate for their energy expenditure. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Elderly; Energy expenditure; Indirect calorimetry; Nursing home",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051103700

The interest in the exploitation of this energy source is tangible according to the fact that different projects are going to be developed in the following years, both in Europe and worldwide. Despite having a huge potential [13] as a very efficient way of energy production, there are several challenges regarding the economic viability of this kind of infrastructure. In this way, the cost reduction associated to maintenance and installation fixings is crucial. The disposal of staff transfer systems between a ship and the generator is one of the main factors that could contribute to the cost reduction. Simultaneously, this system should guarantee the security and being effective in the widest range of sea conditions possible. In this work a review of the main options available in the market is done. Taking into account for each of them the work ranges and the kind of installation, but also security and other important factors that will affect the economic viability of this energy production way.

The historical overview shows how early studies focused on the psychological impacts of the atomic bombs, and living with the spectre of nuclear war. Later research often explored psychological aspects of living with civilian technologies such as nuclear power, and was typically quantitative in approach. Recently, the qualitative and mixed methods literature has expanded. In our systematised review, 26 qualitative and mixed methods studies were found to report on psychological experiences such as living near nuclear power plants and living through a nuclear accident, with common themes described including a lack of trust in authorities, the importance of biography in constituting psychological experience, and factors such as familiarity and sense of place in mediating perceptions.

It has a great potential to have extended lifetime of low-power devices such as wireless sensors, portable devices, and wearable devices. The wireless devices in today’s date require batteries which have a limited lifetime and needs to be replaced with time. In case of wireless sensors that work in harsh environment, it is nearly impossible to replace batteries. The concept of energy harvesting aims to develop devices that do not require replaceable batteries. This is done by converting available energy from the environment into electrical energy to power wireless devices. This paper is focused on piezoelectric energy harvesting.

This because the conservation state of buildings has been neglected for years. Today, the historic area of the city is characterized with buildings in high state of degradation, whose maintenance was in many cases non-existent. The care that a building requires is constantly underwritten and most of the interventions that have actually been verified are plastic rather than structural. Which brings us to another problem, since it is a city with eminent seismic risk. Part of the proposed solutions don’t even show respect for the built heritage history or the necessary attention to the existing mechanical capabilities, which is an obstacle to a balanced and sustainable development. In view of the above, this article purpose is to verify how rehabilitation can make a building sustainable in an city lacking with immediate results. Sustainability should be understood as the communion of indicators that foster proposals with solutions that last in time, economically accessible and of zero or reduced environmental impacts. To this end, case study of a apartment rehabilitation project located in Lisbon’s historic area will be presented, with characteristics that marked a constructive time and on which any proposal can not be invasive.

This study describes a series of detailed energy consumption studies on these devices during clinical use at three major health care centres in Canada, one in British Columbia and two in Ontario. The study was conducted by the Canadian Coalition for Green Health Care [1], with funding provided by Natural Resources Canada [2] and BC Hydro [3]. The primary goal of the study was to accelerate the development of ENERGY STAR specifications for medical imaging equipment. Natural Resources Canada is assisting the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) [4], by collecting these data from the field. Eight testing events were undertaken, providing energy consumption data for low power energy modes, standby/idle power energy modes and active/patient scanning energy modes. Energy consumption was measured over periods ranging from three to eleven days, to provide rich information about when and how frequently the equipment was used and what the associated energy consumption profiles were. Data acquisition rates were varied to gain a detailed understanding of the temporal variations in energy consumption profiles during each use mode. Results from this study showed that there were variations in the low power mode energy consumption of greater than 25% in some cases, and that non-scanning energy consumption, either low power or stand-by modes, in some cases accounted for up to 80% of the total energy consumption of the system at some hospitals. These findings indicate that there is considerable scope for manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption levels of their devices, and for users to reduce energy consumption during clinical use through practices such as placing the system into a lower energy mode or shutting it down while not in use, where possible. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Energy consumption; Imaging devices; Use profiles",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048280990

The analysis covers both shallow and deep geothermal technologies producing electrical power, heat, cold and hot water. It has a focus on the European Union (EU) legislation and its implementation. Indeed, nowadays it results difficult to fully understand the legal system for geothermal energy in a given European country without some acquaintance with the overarching EU framework. To this end, it may be useful to clarify some preliminary principles governing the relations between the EU and its member states. The competences between the two levels are defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. In areas like energy and the environment, where the competence is shared, the EU can legislate when its action is considered to be more effective than the action taken at national, regional or local level. In the framework of the functioning of the European Economic Area, EU rules can apply to Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein. Additionally, they can also apply to other countries (e.g. Switzerland, Turkey) through bilateral agreements. National competences can be further devolved to regional and local authorities depending on the degree of self-governance in each country. The chapter is organised as follows: the first section provides an overview of the EU climate and energy framework; Sect. 2 takes a closer look at the key legal issues for the sector and a brief presentation of the most common mechanisms put in place for supporting geothermal energy; finally, Sect. 3 presents the future energy regulatory framework currently under discussion. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Electricity; Energy policies; Heating and cooling; Regulations",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051219568

Complex models have been developed in literature to reproduce the behavior of these devices. However, for output variables such as power and voltage, one moves in a space of many variables and it is not trivial to reconstruct an overall behavior of the device. The aim of this paper is to provide a wide picture concerning the device behavior investigating experimentally the output power and voltage as a function of the mechanical and especially magnetic bias, varying the amplitude and frequency of the driving vibration. A galfenol rod (Fe81Ga19) sample inserted in a three-legged magnetizer is utilized to vary the magnetic bias and to provide the flux closure to the sample, while a dynamic test machine provides both the mechanical bias and the driving vibration at different frequencies up to 100 Hz. The paper analysis has highlighted that the output power and voltage depend on the magnetic bias according to an exponentially modified Gaussian distribution. Keeping constant the other parameters and varying the mechanical bias, a family of modified Gaussian distributions is obtained. Moreover, fixing the electric load, the amplitude and frequency of the vibration, the couple of values “magnetic bias – mechanical preload” corresponding to the maximum output power of the device depicts a linear behavior. The results here obtained point out that it is possible to simplify the design of magnetostrictive energy harvesters and to obtain high output power even with permanent magnets providing a relatively small coercive field. The results have been confirmed by using two yokes equipped with permanent magnets on the external columns. The maximum output average power obtained with permanent magnets has been 796 mW equal to 6.5 mW/cm3 with a sinusoidal vibration amplitude of 40 MPa at 100 Hz. © 2018 The Authors","Energy harvesting; Magnetic materials; Magnetostrictive devices; Measurements",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052852503

Evaluation in two dimensions is necessary because the effective energy varies depending on the shape of the wedge filter located in the CT device. The purpose of this study was to measure the two-dimensional effective energy distribution of the CT using GAFCHROMIC EBT3 (EBT3), which has a weak energy dependence. The exposure parameters of the 320-multidetector CT were 120 kV, 500 mA, and 5.0 s, and the X-ray tube was stopped at the 0 o’clock position. To avoid scattered radiation, the distance between the EBT3 and other scatterers was set to 200 mm or more. The Al filter thickness was increased from 2 to 20 mm. The irradiated area was divided into 54 compartments, and the density attenuation ratio was measured. The half-value layers (HVLs) were determined using the density attenuation ratios. The effective energies were obtained from the HVLs, and the two-dimensional effective energy distribution was evaluated. Because the thickness of the wedge filter in the longitudinal direction (parallel to the bed) remained unchanged, the variation in the effective energy was negligible in this direction. On the other hand, in the lateral direction (perpendicular to the bed), because the wedge filter gradually thickened from the center to the side, the effective energy from the center to the side increased. The two-dimensional effective energy distribution of the CT could thus be measured using EBT3. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Computed tomography; Effective energy; GAFCHROMIC film",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048269999

Biomass harvested from CW can be used as a renewable energy source and treated effluent can provide irrigation for agricultural uses. Biomass yields for four selected wetland plants in CW, namely Phragmites spp., Typha spp., A. donax, and C. papyrus, ranged from an average of about 1500 g of dry mass per square meter (g/m2) for Typha spp., up to 6000 g/m2 for A. donax. The energy yield for direct combustion of these plants occupied a narrow range, averaging about 18 megajoules per kilogram of dry mass (MJ/kg) for all plant types, a comparable amount to Acacia spp. Methane yields varied from about 170–360 L of methane (normalised to standard conditions) per kilogram of dry mass (LN/kg). 1 m2 of CW planted with A. donax can produce on average 110 MJ through direct combustion or 1660 L of methane from biogas production. In a village of 200 people the biomass from a CW planted with Typha spp. can reduce cooking fuel needs by 4–55% and therefore save up to 12 ha of forest per year. The water footprint of these plants was measured as the percent loss in water in the CW from evapotranspiration (ET). Under a fixed set of assumptions on climate and operation, the water used through ET, the CW could deliver from 64% to 76% of the influent water for subsequent use. In summary, CW have the potential to offset energy and irrigation needs at scales ranging from small communities to peri-urban areas. Constructed wetlands used to treat wastewater have the potential to provide a sustainable bioenergy source without placing burdens on water resources or displacing other food or energy crops. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Food; Nexus Approach; SDGs; Waste; Water",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054021281

Furthermore, the microstructures after the dissolution were observed. The results showed USV greatly accelerated the dissolution rate (by 21–27 times) at the interface, where an uneven ultrasonic pressure distribution in the molten pool caused inhomogeneous dissolution. The amount of Al dissolved in Sn at a particular temperature after 5 s of USV was equivalent to a holding time of 30 min without USV.

On the other hand, securing them against malicious activity is also important. Security and lifetime should work hand in hand to protect and conserve the network. For example, imparting any security solution should not decrease WSN’s lifetime. Thus, a novel energy prediction algorithm is developed and deployed in WSN structure that can actively look and report for any adversaries present within the network and can also report the network’s lifetime stating the remaining amount of time the network can work perfectly without losing its energy. The key idea is that by retrieving the residual energy of the nodes at an instance of time, the proposed algorithm can predict its energy consumption at various other time instances; in such a way how long the nodes can stay alive is predicted. Moreover, we observe that different types of DoS attack consume abnormal amount of energy; by predicting its energy consumption at various instances and comparing with its actual energy consumption, attacks can be identified and classified. This novel mechanism can look for and detect 5 types of DoS attacks at a time. By formulating the network’s lifetime, the design of WSN can be optimized according to the application requirements.

Here we report the results of an fMRI study in which normal-weight healthy participants processed food images during a one-back task or were required to inhibit their response towards food stimuli during a Go/No-Go task. High-energy density (HD) and low-energy density (LD) foods were matched for energy content displayed. Food-related kitchen objects (OBJ) were used as control stimuli. The lateral occipital complex and the orbitofrontal cortex showed consistent higher activity in response to HD than LD foods, both during visual processing and response inhibition. This result suggests that images of HD foods, even when the amount of food shown is not associated with a higher energy content, elicit preferential visual processing - possibly involving attentional processes - and trigger a response from the reward system.

Adopting co-simulation schemes enables the simultaneous use of computational resources and makes it possible to select the most appropriate modelling techniques and algorithms to describe and solve the dynamics of each system component. However, it inherently requires the coupling of different subsystems at discrete communication times, which may compromise the stability of the overall integration process. One of the negative effects of discrete-time communication is the introduction of artificial energy in the system dynamics, which can render the simulation unstable if it accumulates over time. Excess energy can be dissipated introducing virtual damping elements in the subsystem models. The actual amount of damping must be adjusted as the simulation progresses to ensure that all the artificially generated energy is removed from the system while keeping the dynamics realistic. In this paper, we introduce a monitoring framework to keep track of this excess energy, and put forward a dissipation methodology to eliminate it.

Reductions in energy use through behaviour change may be part of the solution but require an insight into the factors that relate to energy saving behaviour in this context. This paper responds to recent calls for an integrated approach to studying energy saving behaviours, investigating psychological (i.e. attitudes; perceived behavioural control; subjective norms), contextual (i.e. dwelling energy efficiency; problems with condensation, damp and mould), and socio-demographic factors (i.e. gender; age) together. Data was collected using a cross-sectional survey among social housing residents in South-West England. Dwelling characteristics were not found to add to explaining heating related and other energy saving behaviours beyond well-known psychological and socio-demographic factors. The results did suggest that the presence of condensation, damp and mould was associated with more frequent heating-related energy saving behaviours, but not other energy saving behaviours.

The supply of electric power at low rates can help in setting ambitious targets to expand the reach of electricity to remote rural areas. The private or local investment to build isolated microgrids could be a cost effective and technically viable solution to extend the electricity access in different countries. However, country specific feasibility studies are required which can help to estimate the required investment and life cycle expenditures. In this paper, an algorithm has been presented for optimal sizing and life cycle cost analysis of an off-grid solar PV system. As a case study, an off-grid PV system is designed to build a zero energy community in five capital cities of Pakistan in order to access the feasibility and potential of off-grid power systems throughout the country. Furthermore, life cycle cost analysis of designed PV system has been carried out in order to determine the unit cost of electricity. The results of economic model show that, the installed PV system can provide electricity at an average rate of 0.082 US$/kWh for all cities with a minimum rate of 0.076 US$/kWh achieved for Quetta whereas; cost of conventional electricity varies from 0.15 to 0.20 US$/kWh in Pakistan. It can be concluded that, installing an off grid PV system in Pakistan is viable both technically and economically. The produced electricity is 45–58% cheaper than the conventional electric power supply used in the country. This study can be used as a benchmarking and guideline to design off-grid PV power systems for other facilities and locations with estimated load demands. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; Off-grid PV; Pakistan; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Zero energy communities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054870758

Among various techniques available to improve the productivity of solar stills, heat storage is one of the proverbial areas in the present scenario. LHES surpasses sensible heat energy storage (SHES) in solar still applications owing to its properties like latent heat, thermal conductivity, etc. Focus has to be given in the selection of suitable LHES material since its properties are very significant during the performance and operation of solar stills. Though previous reviews on LHES in solar stills focus only on the productivity enhancement, this paper presents an up to date comprehensive review exclusively about LHES in solar stills focusing on its productivity, properties of LHES materials and the mechanisms behind the variation in properties of LHES materials. Further, in addition to this, a detailed analysis is also presented in this paper by employing analytical hierarchy process (AHP) which enable the researchers to prioritize the properties during the selection of LHES in solar still applications. Besides AHP analysis, we also evaluate the relative efficiency of the available LHES materials for solar still application by data envelopment analysis (DEA) to find the frontier LHES materials thereby suggesting the methods to augment the properties of the frontier material (identified through DEA analysis). Thus, this paper may be a reference guide in the near future for the academicians, researchers to get an overview about the various LHES materials used in solar stills and significance of their properties for improving the yield in solar still applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AHP; DEA; Latent heat energy storage material; Latent heat energy storage material properties; Paraffin; Solar still",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054282897

However, the stored thermal energy in an LHTES system is not all effective in discharging due to the additional heat transfer resistance between PCM and heat transfer fluid (HTF). An LHTES system could have a higher effective storage capacity than an SWS system only if it is well designed. The optimal design of an LHTES system could be realized only after the effective energy storage ratio, Est, is analyzed in the design stage. In comparison to the laborious computational analysis method, in this work, we developed an analytical technique from the effectiveness-NTU theory to calculate the required heat transfer length and predict Est of the basic unit in any tube-in-tank LHTES system. The technique was first compared with the numerical simulation method we reported earlier, and then used to find the optimal design under various constraints. It was shown that heat transfer enhancement in PCM could effectively improve the effective storage capacity of an optimal design. However, the maximum Est was limited by the thermal resistance in HTF when the enhancement in PCM was over a certain threshold. It was demonstrated that the use of HTF in a low-Re turbulent region could enhance heat transfer in HTF and achieve an Est as high as that in a laminar region while obtaining a higher discharging rate if heat transfer in PCM was well enhanced.

Two interactive programs-ESCT and ES-Select-were utilized in the feasibility study that allowed evaluating various ESTs with regard to their characteristics, costs, benefits, which was carried out for the first time in this region. The study analyzed a variety of power ranges within the power system components including bulk generation, transmission, distribution, commercial and industrial, and residential users.

As it is known they need electrical energy, generally provided by diesel generators. Because of the far and remote distance, the refuelling process is very expensive. So, sustainable development needs hybridization with a local renewable energy (solar energy in this case). Accordingly, the PV panels produce sometimes an excess of power and in other times a lack of power. To overcome this uncontrolled power production, storage device is mandatory. In this work a pump storage hydroelectric system is preferred for its ecological aspect and the subject context. The energy management of this hybridization type requires a specific control. The proposed energy management takes into account the temporal solar energy availability and link it to the online diesel fuel consumption optimization and the pumping constraints. The proposal proves the effectiveness of pump storage hydroelectric double effect system in the irrigation and electrical power restitution, in addition to fuel saving and reduction of CO2 emission.

While these aspects show that the research is increasingly dealing with software issues of Green IT, these mainly scientific ideas have hardly reached practical relevance, so far. Hence, following the life cycle perspective of software products, we present two exemplary concepts on how to increase awareness of green software: addressing especially software engineers, we propose to implement continuous energy efficiency measurements during the development phase. With regards to software users, we propose to create an eco-label for software products to inform about their environmental issues and thus create more transparency in this context. To do so, we present and evaluate criteria and indicators, upon which a label could be based. The chapter concludes with a summary and proposes future activities in the addressed field. Overall, the aim of the chapter is to point out solutions that might lead to a more environmentally friendly way of developing software, a well-informed procurement behavior regarding software products, and a more sustainable user behavior concerning ICT. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Eco-label; Energy efficiency; Energy measurements; Environment; Green software; Green software development",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054170749

This paper presents a novel approach for defining energy system of a carbon neutral island which utilizes only intermittent renewable energy sources in combination with vehicle-to-grid concept as a demand response technology, where marine transportation has also been taken into account. Integration of power, heating, cooling and transport sectors has been modelled by using EnergyPLAN tool, i.e. its updated November 2017 version which is capable of simulating vehicle-to-grid operation in mentioned conditions. Power supply capacities have been selected not by using scenario analysis but by implementing an optimization procedure based on series of simulations in EnergyPLAN tool. In order to choose the most suitable power supply system configuration, two boundary conditions have been defined. Firstly, only solar and wind capacities must be utilized. Secondly, total electricity import and export must be balanced, i.e. the island has to be CO2 neutral. In order to validate the approach, Croatian Island of Korčula has been used as the case study. 2011 has been selected as the base year for which final energy consumption has been calculated. The final simulation year was set to 2030 in which optimal capacities are installed. It has been shown that configuration with 40 MW of wind and 6 MW of installed solar capacities presents the least cost solution, while 22 MW of wind in combination with 30 MW of installed solar capacities provides the lowest amount of total electricity import and export. Analysis of the vehicle-to-grid share reduction has shown increase in total import and export in both cases, while transmission peak loads have not been influenced. © 2018 The Authors","Batteries; Energy planning; EnergyPLAN; Islands; Renewable energy sources; Vehicle-to-grid",Review,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054738846

To achieve high demand response participation, the European Union recognises the need for adequate financial incentives for all consumers, especially for residential and service sector consumers. However, the European Energy Tax Directive, which regulates energy taxation in the European Union, is currently not in alignment with this vision, as it does not provide any financial incentives for demand response participation. This paper explores the potential of energy taxes to provide such incentives. First, through an analysis of the current energy taxation and demand response literature. Second, by quantifying the difference in financial incentives between two tax designs (per-unit and ad valorem taxes) in a simulation case study of consumers heat pumps in the Netherlands. Results show that financial incentives are 3.5 times higher for the ad valorem tax than for the per-unit tax.

These piles are mainly designed for highest possible thermal conductance. In this paper, nine factors influencing the thermal conductance of the energy pile are defined and statistically evaluated. These nine factors are; number of tubes, pile diameter, tube diameter, tube thickness, tube location, pile conductivity, tube conductivity, soil conductivity, and water flow rate. The thermal conductance of the energy pile is calculated using finite element model. The significance of these factors is evaluated using fractional factorial uniform design of experiment. The results show significance increase in the pile thermal conductance with the increase of the tube diameter, number of tubes, water flow rate, and tube and pile thermal conductivities. Furthermore, the tubes location near the pile outer surface show significant increase in the pile thermal conductance. On the other hand, decreasing pile diameter slightly increases the pile thermal conductance.

The presence of the upstream body changes flow structure around the hydrofoil and enhances efficiency significantly by two mechanisms. Mutual interaction of the vortex shed from the upstream body and the leading-edge vortex of the hydrofoil precipitates the separation of the leading-edge vortex from the hydrofoil and its streamwise transport. The incoming flow deflected by the upstream body changes the effective angle of attack for the hydrofoil. These phenomena significantly increase heaving force and pitching moment during stroke reversal, and major contribution to efficiency enhancement is from the change in pitching moment. 30% increase in efficiency, relative to a hydrofoil without an upstream body, can be achieved for same kinematics. However, the upstream body may be disadvantageous in some configurations. If the hydrofoil is placed closely to the body in transverse direction, the leading-edge vortex formation is suppressed after stroke reversal. When flapping frequency does not match with vortex shedding frequency of the upstream body, non-periodic flow structure formed around the hydrofoil can cause efficiency drop and irregular power generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bluff body; Energy harvesting; Flapping hydrofoil; Hydrodynamics; Leading-edge vortex; Ocean energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049093411

An overview is presented of how technologies, barriers and policies relate in the models. Furthermore, the core policy recommendations from existing models are presented. The analysis shows that the reviewed studies predominantly focus on a subset of barriers – a lack of capital, a lack of information, high upfront cost, ignorance, inertia and other priorities. So far, agent-based models have focused on how subsidies, technology bans and information campaigns influence energy efficiency adoption.

The argument empirically unfolds using material from six months of ethnographic fieldwork that focused on a heater replacement policy program in central and southern Chile. Using the data we collected from participant observation and follow-up interviews, we describe the installation phase and establishment of new less polluting heaters, as well as how the installation of those new heaters problematizes and redefines preexisting heating ecologies that constitute domestic and non-domestic practices and infrastructures linked to firewood heating.

The given paper presents a mathematical model of active power losses of local electrical systems - electrical systems of power supply companies. The sources of electricity for such systems are not only powerful electric stations, but also renewable energy sources. Often these are distributed sources of energy.

The significance of these similarity criteria can be determined from the optimality conditions of the dual criterion programming problem with respect to the direct problem.

But since the design complexity, size and density continue to increase, new power saving techniques need to be developed to compete in such challenging market. The 7 nm technological node which is currently the most advanced node has presented many difficulties, especially in physical design and verification phases. But also it gives a very good opportunity for power optimization due to the big electrical differences between its metal layers and the reduction of the overall parasitic capacitances.

Characterization experiments were run on a 7 nm SoC and the results show that the best Power-Performance trade-off is achieved when the operating frequency is between 400 MHz and 1.5 GHz. Going for frequency greater than the optimal one scale the power consumption exponentially. And scale the frequency lesser than the optimal frequency impacts the circuit speed without benefiting that much the power consumption of the design. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Efficiency; Electro-migration; Energy; Performance; Power consumption; Thermal dissipation; Tradeoff",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051759305

Between February and May 2016, forty-two households in two Swiss cities were actively involved and monitored along with corresponding control group of forty households. The intervention engaged app users in a neighborhood challenge to complete electricity saving activities and realize their progress through electricity use visualization. One year after the intervention, electricity consumption was measured, and follow-up online surveys measured reported behavior and perceived injunctive norms of the participants. During the intervention, participants significantly reduced their electricity use, with respect to both historical consumption and the control groups. However, after one year it was found that the electricity savings achieved during the intervention were not maintained. In contrast, the participants reported their behavior as more efficient compared to before the intervention and still perceived the impact of the intervention in their community.

The majority of MGs work in grid-connected mode. ESS is used to store additional power created by sustainable power sources for the duration of low demand period and redispatching during high demand period.

Policy mechanisms to reduce emissions are required to reach environmental quality goals. Projecting the drivers (e.g., technical, economic, societal, regulatory) that will impact future emissions is challenging, and assessing regional air quality (AQ) is complicated by the need for detailed modeling tools and data inputs to simulate chemistry and transport of pollutants. This work assesses the contribution of emissions from transportation sources to ground-level concentrations of ozone and fine particulate matter via two methods. First, impacts are quantified for three U.S. regions including California using output from an economic optimization model to grow a base year emissions inventory to 2055. Second, impacts are considered for California using state-level projections with an updated emissions inventory and modeling suite in 2035. For both, advanced AQ models are used, showing that the impacts of light duty vehicles are moderate, reflecting shifts to more efficient and lower emitting technologies. In contrast, heavy duty vehicles, ships, and off-road equipment are associated with important ozone and PM2.5 burdens. Emissions from petroleum fuel production and distribution activities also have notable impacts on ozone and PM2.5.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) usually does not account for the variations in the energy sources that supply an electricity grid every day, month and year. This study addresses the dynamic nature of electricity grids and accounts for the source variations in electricity production using electricity grid data at high temporal resolutions. The study compares inventory data on electricity grid composition at hourly, daily and monthly resolutions with the conventional yearly average grid compositions from the ecoinvent database. The high-resolution electricity grid inventory data are subsequently paired with data sets for electricity consumption by buildings with matching resolutions in order to quantify the differences in the environmental performance of buildings resulting from the application of temporally high-resolution grid data. Finally, environmental building performance (EBP) calculated using high-resolution grids is compared to EBPs generated from conventional data resolutions. The results indicate that the contribution to global warming potential is closely related to the data resolution of the grid composition and that the EBP may be overestimated by up to a factor of two when compared with conventional grid inventory data with yearly (i.e. low) data resolutions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building; Consumption data; Dynamic LCA; Energy; Environmental performance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054627962

However, little is known about the modifications in FAs induced by high CO2 that can improve fruit quality and prevent the disorders associated with storage at low temperature. For this purpose, total, free and esterified FAs in neutral and polar lipid fractions were characterized and quantified and their relationship with straight-chain esters was examined in strawberries treated with high doses of CO2 and different times of exposure during early storage at 0 °C. In strawberries stored without added CO2 (T1), storage at 0 °C led to an imbalance in the saturated/unsaturated ratio of polar lipids, mainly due to the decrease in the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA). In addition, a decrease in the amount of free polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) linked to a prevalence of butanoates and hexanoates esterified to long alcohols was observed. A strong negative correlation (P ≤ 0.01; r ≥ 0.7) between butanoate esters and free PUFA was quantified. In contrast, the application of 2 d 20 kPa CO2 treatment (T2), increased the amount of PUFA from the neutral and polar fractions, with a preference for α-linolenic acid (18:3n3) which results in a rise in the 18:3/18:2 ratio, and which can confer membrane stability and fluidity. Furthermore, our results also showed a strong positive correlation (P ≤ 0.01; r ≥ 0.75) between α-linolenic acid (18:3n3) of polar lipids and some ethyl esters that contribute mostly to the aroma in strawberries. However, 3 d 40 kPa CO2 treatment (T4) depleted the content of FAs from all the lipid fractions in association with deficit ATP levels and an increased lipid peroxidation. These results suggest an active lipid breakdown which could play a causal role in the reported increased leakage of cellular water into intercellular air spaces in stressed-CO2 fruit. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the beneficial effect of 2 d 20 kPa CO2 treatment at 0 °C on the enhancement of PUFA in the polar lipid fraction and on the emission of esters other than ethyl acetate, which could improve membrane fluidity and could contribute to enriching aroma in strawberries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy supply; Firmness; Lipid fractions; MDA; Volatile esters",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054738809

This waste derived fuel can be produced from different waste streams after significant mechanical and biological processing. In spite of their processing, these waste derived fuels still have a high degree of heterogeneity, presenting variable fuel properties and some negative characteristics such as high moisture, ash and chlorine contents. Although RDF is used for energy generation in some high energy demanding industrial applications or dedicated energy recovery facilities, its physical-chemical characteristics can result in significant technical and environmental problems that may benefit from an upgrading treatment. Torrefaction and carbonization are thermal treatments that have the potential to upgrade RDF, producing a waste derived char with reduced moisture and chlorine contents, more homogeneous and friable, which are characteristics of great importance for feeding systems in gasification and combustion facilities.

If FESS is to compete with conventional electro-chemical batteries in terms of energy density, the magnetic bearings must be dimensioned optimally for weight and size. Magnetically suspended FESS has been experimentally investigated; however, the methods for theoretically predicting magnetic bearing loads are still limited. This paper presents how to determine such magnetic bearing loads in a gimballed FESS subject to a moving foundation. The predicted forces are compared with measurements from an experimental test bench with good agreement. Furthermore, the maximum forces in a gimballed FESS are compared with maximum forces in a non-gimballed FESS. It was found that the gyroscopic forces in the non-gimballed case quickly become critical making the gimbal mount essential for reducing magnetic bearing loads. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Active magnetic bearings; Flywheel energy storage system; Permanent magnet bearings",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052243096

The research: 1) quantifies the interconnections between water, energy, and transportation systems specific to the Eagle Ford shale region; 2) identifies and quantifies the economic, social, and environmental indicators to evaluate scenarios of oil and gas production; and 3) develops a framework for analysis of the economic, societal, and long term sustainability of the sectors and 4) an assessment tool (WET Tool) that estimates several economic indicators: oil and natural gas production, direct and indirect tax revenues, and average wages for each scenario facilitates the holistic assessment of oil and gas production scenarios and their associated trade-offs between them. Additionally, the Tool evaluates these social and environmental indices, (water demand, emissions, water tanker traffic, accidents, road deterioration, and expected average employment times). Scale of production is derived from the price of oil and gas; government revenues from production fluctuations in relation to rise and fall of the oil and gas market prices. While the economic benefits are straightforward, the social costs of shale development (water consumption, carbon emissions, and transportation/infrastructure factors), are difficult to quantify. The tool quantifies and assesses potential scenario outcomes, providing an aid to decision makers in the public and private sectors that allows increased understanding of the implications of each scenario for each sector by summarizing projected outcomes to allow evaluation of the scenarios and comparison of choices and facilitate the essential dialogue between these sectors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Hydraulic fracturing; Sustainability; Trade-offs; Water-energy-transportation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050913555

This has been recently explored for improved solutions. This paper proposes a method of extracting key frames (or poses) of human activities from skeleton joint coordinates information obtained using an RGB-D Camera (Depth Sensor). The motion energy (kinetic energy) of each pose in an activity sequence is computed and a novel approach is proposed for extracting key pose locations that define an activity using moving average crossovers of computed pose kinetic energy. This is important as not all frames of an activity sequence are key in defining the activity. In order to evaluate the reliability of extracted key poses, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which is capable to learn a sequence of transition from states in an activity is applied in classifying activities from identified key poses.

We use panel survey with embedded experimental treatments that randomly assign different economic frames for the costs and benefits of renewable energy. We find that economic frames affect how people think about renewable energy and framing renewable energy policies in terms of costs, i.e. high electricity bills, has more impact on attitudes than framing it in terms of economic benefits. Positive frames in which renewable energy is linked to greater job creation and economic development are less effective. We theorize this asymmetrical framing effect may be happening because individuals evaluate the direct economic costs to themselves to be more important than broad, dispersed economic benefits to society. It may also be because people generally have more information about the benefits of renewable energy but less so about the personal economic costs. When exposed to information that renewable energy might be directly costly to them, individuals react to the negative treatment more. There has been relatively little systematic experimental research on renewable energy attitudes and as such our study makes an important contribution to the literature by examining the relative effectiveness of economic cost and benefit frames on public opinion toward different dimensions of renewable energy. Our findings may also inform policymaking by emphasizing the power of couching renewable energy in ways that individuals can connect with directly and on a personal level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Economic costs; Framing; Public opinion; Public support; Renewable energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052866331

On the other hand, excessive penetration of distributed generation (DG) systems into electrical networks may lead to various problems and operational limit violations, such as over and under voltages, excessive line losses, overloading of transformers and feeders, protection failure and high harmonic distortion levels exceeding the limits of international standards. These problems occur when the system exceeds its hosting capacity (HC) limit. The HC is a transactive approach that provides a way for the distribution network to be integrated with different types of energy systems. Accordingly, HC assessment and enhancements become an essential target for both distribution system operators and DG investors. This paper provides, for the first time, a systematic and extensive overview of the HC research, developments, assessment techniques and enhancement technologies. The paper consists of four HC principal sections: historical developments, performance limits, perceptions and enhancement techniques. Besides, practical experiences of system operators, energy markets and outcomes gained from real case studies are presented and discussed.

Through the energy-based discrimination of the photons, obtained by setting up the discriminator threshold at different levels, PCXDs allow measuring photon energies with an accuracy appropriate for several practical applications. The major potentials of this approach are multiple contrast images (sometimes referred to as “color” or “spectral” images), obtained by using a single polychromatic source. In contrast to multiple acquisitions with different tube spectra, photon-counting spectral CT eliminates the risk of misregistration due to motion between consecutive scans and it allows for the elimination of dark noise in the image by rejecting all the events below the signal threshold. Of particular importance is the application of spectral CT in preclinical models where small animals are scanned and an effective discrimination among e.g. soft-tissue, bone and K-edge contrast agents can be in principle performed in a single shot. While spectral CT is considered very promising, its practical application has been hampered by the charge sharing issue that negatively affects the energy resolution of PCXDs. However, latest generations of PCXDs implement solutions to cope with the charge sharing effects, thus allowing sharp color sensitivity. This work presents a comparison of K-edge spectral CT images acquired with the Pixirad-I/Pixie-III detector with and without the application of a charge sharing recovery solution. When a solution for the charge sharing issue is considered both the spatial accuracy and energy resolution are preserved, thus allowing accurate K-edge subtraction imaging. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Computed tomography; Energy resolution; K-edge imaging; Photon counting detectors",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048255021

To preserve the frequency stability while the generating units maneuvering and costumers’ inconvenience are minimized, tuning the parameters of the proposed frequency control scheme has been modeled as two multi-objective optimization problems with appropriate objective functions. A proper method has been proposed for solving the optimization problems which is successful in obtaining solutions that guarantee achieving the goals determined for the frequency control scheme. The proposed scheme enables the system operator to optimally manage the frequency control reserve provided by loads and online generating units.

During these processes, minerals will cleave or fracture along specific crystal directions, where there are weak inter-planar bonds, generating exposed surfaces. On an exposed mineral surface, different ions can possess different numbers of broken bonds. The total number of broken bonds of all ions on the exposed surface can be considered as the number of broken bonds of the exposed surface. The broken bonds on the exposed surface make the latter more active and determine its reactivity. The broken bond density on the exposed surfaces of fluorite was calculated, enabling the anisotropic surface reactivity of fluorite such as surface energy, surface relaxation, dissolution, wettability, surface charge and adsorbability to be revisited. The results show that the surface broken bond density, which is related to the specific surface energy, could be used to predict the cleavage nature, surface relaxation degree, dissolution rate and surface stability of fluorite crystal. The distribution feature and the number of broken bonds of exposed active ions (such as Ca2+ for fluorite) can be used to predict and explain the anisotropic surface wettability and surface charge, as well as the adsorption mode and strength of organic molecule binding to different exposed surfaces.

Clustering is a popular approach to overcome this problem. Also, it is a particular energy efficient mechanism within large scale wireless sensor networks. Most problems of the computer systems like wireless sensor network could not be solved by linear solutions and there is not any deterministic solution for most NP-hard problems and the result of such problems is always optimizing. To solve these problems, applying evolutionary algorithms is recommended. The bat algorithm could find the shortest path between member nodes of the cluster and cluster head. In this paper, to reduce the energy consumption in wireless sensor nodes and also select the suitable cluster heads, the capabilities of combining the evolutionary bat algorithm and chaotic map is used. Applying chaotic map instead of some particular and random parameters in the bat algorithm improves the clustering. The results obtained from the implementation of the proposed method in MATLAB and their comparison with the existing methods such as GA, GAPSO, LEACH and LEACH-T represent significant impact in energy consumption improvement, network lifetime increase and also the number of live nodes increase within different rounds of algorithm execution. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Bat algorithm; Chaotic map; Clustering; Energy efficiency; Wireless sensor network",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054317143

Domestically, there are two fisheries; one at a commercial scale and one for subsistence purposes. Both fisheries involve harvesting all viscera (digestive tract, gonads and respiratory tree) through a lateral body wall incision, although only the digestive tract and gonads are consumed. Under the right conditions the sea cucumber can survive organ harvest and regenerate the viscera. This study investigated the biochemical and physiological consequences of organ regeneration by comparing sham (longitudinal body wall incision without organ removal) and excised (internal tissues removed after incision) sea cucumbers to control (handled but not incised) animals. Biochemical measurements of lactate, glucose, and glycogen showed that body wall energy reserves were depleted in both sham and excised animals relative to controls at the Day 10 measurement. The presence of an energy substrate depletion in sham animals indicated an effect related to loss of body wall integrity, rather than internal organ regeneration. Although the regeneration of digestive and respiratory organs was rapid, oxygen consumption rate and ammonia excretion rate were unchanged in excised and sham animals relative to controls. These data suggest that S. horrens can survive the internal organ harvest associated with subsistence fishing and regenerate excised tissues rapidly. However, this comes at an energetic cost that is likely to affect growth and reproduction. Fisheries management measures such as the implementation of a minimum rest period between harvests may promote the sustainability of this important fishery. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy; Metabolism; Regeneration costs; Sea cucumber; Subsistence fishery",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054877298

The 3D model was established and the Realizable k-ε turbulence model was used in Fluent to analyze how the nozzle-to-throat clearance and throat length affect the working performance of the jet pump. The reasonable structural parameters of nozzle-to-throat clearance and throat length were determined as 19.75 and 98 mm, respectively.

Results show that when the water injection pressure ranges from 1.4 to 4.0 MPa, the water flow change from 605 to 273 m3/d with the 50% nozzle opening and the water flow changes from 803 to 657 m3/d with the 90% nozzle opening. By adjusting the nozzle opening, the adjustable jet pump can basically achieve the multiple combinations of injection pressure and flow.

The expedited thermal cracking attributed to employing CO2 in pyrolysis of SCGs led to changing pyrolytic products in gas, liquid, and solid phases. The production of gaseous carbon monoxide was increased when using CO2 as the pyrolysis medium. In liquid pyrolytic products, the formation of phenolic compounds was hindered in the CO2-assited pyrolysis.

However, geothermal technology is also controversial. Existing studies on public responses to geothermal energy focus on the question of support for the technology, and on the identification of reasons and arguments that cause opposition. In this article, we will shed light on the different responses to innovative geothermal energy technologies at the local level. We rely on the assumption that these responses are rendered visible through different framings of the technology. We conducted four focus groups in two German communities with a total of 27 participants. Our case study approach reveals the diversity of local understandings of geothermal energy, which differ within and between communities. Our analysis shows that local actors do not primarily frame deep geothermal energy as a renewable energy. Instead, they tend to see it as an emerging technology that still requires further development, or view it in terms of its possible environmental impact. We argue that by taking into consideration the diversity of frames, it is possible to gain a better understanding of potential controversies regarding the technology, and to develop deep geothermal energy projects in a way that aligns with the needs of local actors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deep geothermal energy; Framing; Local controversies; Public discourses",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053014208

In this paper, a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the water evaporation in a bi-layer structure is firstly established and then the finite element method is used to simulate the effects of different influence factors on the evaporation rate. Results turn out that: besides the high solar energy absorptivity of the first-layer, an optimum porosity of the second-layer porous material should be applied and the optimum porosity is about 0.45 in this work. This optimum porosity is determined by the balance between the positive effect of the lowering effective thermal conductivity of the second layer and the negative effect of the reduced vapor diffusivity in the second layer when the porosity is decreased. The influence of the thermal conductivity of the second-layer porous material is negligible because the effective thermal conductivity of the second layer is determined by the porosity while a larger porosity means more water in the second layer. The ambient air velocity could greatly enhance the evaporation rate, and the evaporation rate will decrease linearly with the increase of the air relative humidity. This study is expected to supply some information for developing a more effective bi-layer solar steam generation system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Numerical method; Porous material; Solar energy; Solar steam generation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053781359

Visible luminescence spectra have been obtained for Dy3+ ions and Eu3+ ions under 350 nm excitation. Yellow emission of Dy3+ was exhibited mainly due to the transition 4F9/2→6H13/2 centered at 573 nm. Energy transfer between Dy3+ and Eu3+ ions and decay curves of Dy3+ and Dy3+/Eu3+ co-doped KFP glasses have been studied using fluorescence spectra. The decay of 4F9/2 excited level is found to be single exponential for lower concentrations up to 0.3 mol% and becomes non-exponential for (greater than 0.3 mol%) higher concentrations. It is noticed that with the increase of Dy3+ concentration, the lifetime values of 4F9/2 level was decreased. Intense Reddish orange light was observed in addition to blue and yellow luminescence in these glasses. CIE chromaticity coordinates were calculated to study the generation of white light from the luminescent transitions.

In this work, it was studied the application of waste-to-energy technologies to RDF valorisation, namely pyrolysis and gasification. This study intended to evaluate the effect of temperature and different technologies (gasification and pyrolysis) in gas production, gas composition and mass conversion of RDF. Experiments of RDF gasification and pyrolysis were performed in a laboratory scale fixed bed gasifier, under different conditions. The effect of reaction temperature was studied at 450, 600 and 750Â °C in pyrolysis experiments and at 750 °C and 850 °C in gasification. Results showed that, for the same operational conditions, pyrolysis was more efficient at 750 °C.

Results also proved that, for the same operational conditions, the rise of temperature improved gas production ratio (Nm3/kg RDF), gas low heating value (LHV) and mass conversion. Regarding to gas production ratio the utilization of air at equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.6 induced the formation of 1.5 m3 gas/kg RDF.

Here we cover the topic of energy landscapes, where we focus on energy definitions based on analytic forms to describe the interaction between atoms or ions (e.g., Lennard Jones potential)—but clearly these expressions can be replaced with a more full treatment of electronic structure. We also introduce various Monte Carlo approaches typically employed to explore these landscapes. We employ analogies to help with the understanding of how the various algorithms work and give a range of concrete published examples based on the modeling of nanoclusters and nanoparticles of inorganic materials (we leave the coverage of other types of nanoparticles such as metallic clusters and their alloys for later chapters). The development of algorithms for exploring energy landscapes is still very active, where the objectives are to improve their computational efficiency, and/or to expand the range of targeted features/properties. For the latter, historically only the athermal lowest energy minima were first targeted. Afterward, transition points or barriers between minima were also targeted. Nowadays, temperature, pressure, chemical potential, probability flows, and lifetimes of metastable states may all be targeted. For the former objective, reduction in the computational cost of completing a search of an energy landscape may be achieved by a number of means such as (i) employing cheaper to evaluate, yet coarser, measures of the energy landscape before using more computationally expensive refined measures; (ii) employing machine learning algorithms to eventually (once a sufficient training set has been obtained) remove the need to compute the chosen expensive to evaluate the measure of the energy landscape; and (iii) ensuring a search does not get stuck in localized regions through the use of evolutionary ideas (e.g., structural mutations, grouping structures into niches) to maintain or increase the structural diversity in a set of candidate nanoparticle structures. Although new approaches to exploring energy landscapes are continually being proposed, the required foundational background for describing energy landscapes and searching them can be found in numerous text books or reviews on this topic.

PSS enable companies to fulfill individual customer requirements and to build long-term customer relationships. Besides their economic advantages, PSS are attributed to positive effects on ecological sustainability. However, the complex structure of PSS challenges the quantification of their impact on all aspects of ecological sustainability. This leads to the demand for quantification methods with increased practical applicability compared to methods that encompass all aspects of ecological sustainability like the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). In this context, the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) is an elaborated method that enables the comparison of different products or services regarding their primary energy demand. Since many aspects of ecological sustainability correlate to the primary energy demand, CED is seen as a suitable estimate of the results of an LCA with reduced efforts and complexity. In consequence, the adaption of the CED method to PSS is a promising research task that could support the design and operation of PSS with increased ecological sustainability. Therefore, this paper presents an approach to systematically analyze and reduce the CED of a PSS (CEDPSS). In order to validate the feasibility of the approach, a use case from agriculture machinery is carried out. The results indicate that the technical product is responsible for a large percentage of CEDPSS, while services have a relatively low impact.

Using storage capacities becomes crucial to sustainably guarantee stable energy supply. In particular battery storage systems (BSS) are expected to successfully compete with alternative options for energy storage in the near future. Major issues with state-of-the-art BSS include comparatively high costs, limited efficiency as well as reliability, and a low fault tolerance. A leap in power electronics technology might meet these challenges, as the aforementioned characteristics are predominantly determined by existing power converter and BSS architectures. This paper presents the so-called AC Battery – a novel modular multilevel parallel converter based split battery system for AC applications, enabling dynamic switching of battery cells in parallel and in series. Each individual battery cell may be interconnected to its neighbors according to operational needs, e.g. to provide optimum source resistance, lowest state-of-charge (SOC) cycling, and balanced aging, rendering separate battery management systems (BMS) unnecessary. Applying the proposed technology in grid scale BSS may fundamentally change existing system architectures, as it merges battery storage system and power converter.

Considering the human-landscape system associated with energy policy, these changes can affect landscape and natural resources over a range of temporal and special scales. Thus, the aim of study was on how human-landscape interactions have influenced the geomorphological dynamics in a São Paulo region that contains sugar cane crops associated with soils derived from sandstones and mudstones. The use of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in three different scenarios from land use changes allowed verifying how they have affected soil loss: natural conditions (savannah), current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops. In addition, the total sediment transported, the sediment delivery ratio and the rate of soil removal were measured, considering the current land use. The land use scenarios pointed out that the land use change is directly related to increasing rates of soil loss, i.e. 0.03, 3.5 and 12.6 t ha−1 yr−1 for the natural conditions, current land use and with the expansion of sugar cane crops, respectively. These rates in the current land use and with continuous expansion of sugar cane crops are higher than the tolerable erosion limits in 17 and 57% of the study area, respectively. The suspended sediment concentration increases with increasing Cachoeirinha Stream discharge, with a specific daily flux of 88 kg km−2 day−1. The mean monthly flux in 2014 was 32 t month−1, with varying from 3.1 (August) to 144 (January) t month−1. The wet period was responsible for ca. 90% (436 t) of the total solids transported in 2014. The sediment delivery ratio was 9% of the total soil loss. The current rate of soil removal of 25.8 m Myr−1 is almost 3-fold higher than the long-term denudation rates suggested for the Peripheral Depression (9 m Myr−1). With the continuous expansion of sugar cane crops, the rate of soil removal probably will be higher than that obtained in the current scenario and, consequently, the current denudation rates should increase further. Thus, this study reinforce that the human-landscape systems in São Paulo State associated with energy policy are complex and increase the natural processes of soil removal and, consequently, affect the landscape evolution. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Energy policy; Human-landscape system; Landscape evolution",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053013978

However, different studies suggest that reinforced concrete is not environmentally friendly with a significant adverse environmental impact during its production, usage and end of life. Therefore, a more sustainable material that could perform as well as reinforced concrete can overcome this limitation. During the past decade, a number of studies on timber construction have shown the potential to replace concrete with timber in parts of a building without compromising the resilience of the structure. Most of them focused on greenhouse gas emissions rather than embodied energy and structural requirements. Therefore, this research has focused on the feasibility of timber and its potential benefits as a construction material in parts of a high-rise building located in Australia. The potential benefits and limitations of utilising timber to construct a high-rise building in Australia were investigated. For this purpose, a hypothetical 43-storey building is considered, to make it comparable with the existing studies in the literature; the baseline model is designed according to the study by Kuilen et al. (2011). Three scenarios were considered with different proportion of timber. Parametric studies were subsequently conducted on the effects of materials, size and shape of the structural elements on the performance of the building. It was found that in the selected site, using timber to construct internal parts of high-rise buildings would provide the best solution in terms of structural and environmental benefits. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CLT; Embodied carbon; Embodied energy; High rise building; Timber",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054690125

Monitoring the border through soldiers is not perfect surveillance, due to the natural factors of human beings may be the error will occur in the border surveillance.

We find that, ceteris paribus, familiarity and climate change risk perceptions have the greatest effect on smart meter acceptance, while smart meter acceptance, age, and income have the strongest effect on engagement.

Lastly, a minimum cost function was proposed to carefully choose parent or forwarder node that has the highest residual energy and the shortest distance to sink.

Track vibration has been proposed as a potential energy source to power wireless sensors for this purpose. Vibration-based energy harvesting devices generally exploit resonance, and hence need to be tuned to a particular target frequency. Thus, to harvest energy from the vibrations of a passing train, the spectral content of the track vibration needs to be known. This paper describes a fundamental investigation into the factors that govern this spectral content. A simple model of the train and the track, together with data from five trains passing at four different sites are used in this investigation. It is shown that the deflection under an individual wheel effectively acts as a bandpass filter, restricting the acceleration spectrum of sleeper vibration to low frequencies. The train geometry has an important effect on which specific trainload frequency has the largest response amplitude. For the trains studied, it was found that the 7th trainload frequency had the highest amplitude in four out of the five cases. The physical reasons as to why this trainload frequency is the largest are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy harvesting; Track vibration; Train-induced vibration; Trainload frequency",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047115225

The main housing renovation policies implemented in Spain were submitted to analysis using the focus of Life Cycle Approaches. Representative case studies were selected based on the analysis of 3245 real renovation solutions funded by policy programmes in the period between 2010 and 2014. Current solutions were assessed and compared to other retrofit scenarios that a priori might seem more desirable when striving for energy-efficient buildings. Multi-criteria assessment results reveal that the current renovation strategies applied in Madrid and Seville are, by no means optimal solutions, while only a small additional cost could produce significant performance improvement in Bilbao. The Passivhaus standard that offers the greatest reduction of energy consumption in all three cities would appear, however, not to be the solution of choice for any of them. These findings demonstrate the need to integrate Life Cycle thinking into the building process to identify the most sustainable energy pathways. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Housing renovation; Life cycle thinking; Public policy; Retrofit",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054742821

Meanwhile, smooth grid synchronization and connection can be achieved.

With their increased use for policy assessment and increasing dominance in energy policy science, such models attract increasing criticism. In the last years, such models – especially the highly complex IAMs, have been accused of being arbitrary. We challenge this view and argue that the models and their assumptions are not arbitrary, but they are normative and reflect the modelers’ understanding of the functioning of the society, the environment-societal relations and respective appropriate scientific tools and theories – in short: models are shaped by discursive structures, reproducing and reinforcing particular societal discourses. We identify 9 distinct paths, all relating to crucial model decisions, via which discourses enter models: for each of these decisions, there are multiple “correct” answers, in the sense that they can be justified within a particular discourse. We conclude that decisions of modelers about the structure and about assumptions in energy modeling are not arbitrary but contingent to the discursive context the modeler is related to. This has two implications. First, modelers and consumers of model output must reflect on what a model and its assumptions represent, and not only whether are they correct. Second, models hardly need to add more (mathematical) complexity, but rather be reduced and simplified so that they can continue to fulfill their main function as formalized and powerful instruments for thought experiments about future energy pathways. © 2018 The Authors","Constructivism; Discourses; Energy models; Integrated assessment models; SKAD",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053000555

Geothermal energy is the thermal energy stored underground, including any contained fluid, which is available for extraction and conversion into energy products. Electricity generation, which today produces 73.7 TWh (12.7 GW of capacity) worldwide, usually requires geothermal temperatures of over 100 °C. For heating, geothermal resources that span a wider range of temperatures can be used in various heat applications such as; space and district (and cooling, with the appropriate technology), spas and swimming pools, greenhouses and soil, aquaculture ponds, industrial processes and snow melting. The geothermal heat produced worldwide is 164.6 TWh, with a capacity of 70.9 GW. Geothermal resources are immune from weather and seasonal variations, and can produce a base-load (continuously) or adapt to the energy demand, providing a flexible and “smart” renewable energy source. To guarantee a sustainable use of geothermal energy, the consumption rate should not exceed the generation rate, so that the heat removed from the resource is replaced within a similar time scale, and geothermal plants typically produce energy below a certain level. In addition, any impact on the environment should be controlled, mitigated and managed. Any non-sustainable use of geothermal technologies can create a misperception of geothermal energy and social resistance to geothermal development. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Economic aspects; Environmental performance; Geothermal energy; Technological applications",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051166747

Therefore, resource allocation technique that is energy-efficient are needed to minimize datacenters energy consumption. This paper proposes Energy-Efficient Flower Pollination Algorithm (EE-FPA) for optimal resource allocation of datacenter Virtual Machines (VMs) and also resource under-utilization. We presented the system framework that supports allocation of multiple VMs instances on a Physical Machine (PM) known as a server which has the potential to increase the energy efficiency as well resource utilization in Cloud datacenter. The proposed technique uses Processor, Storage and Memory as major resource component of PM to allocate a set of VMs, such that the capacity of PM will satisfy the resource requirement of all VMs operating on it. The experiment was conducted on Multi-RecCloudSim using Planet workload. The results indicate that the proposed technique energy consumption outperform the benchmarking techniques which include GAPA, and OEMACS with 91% and 94.5% energy consumption while EE-FPA is around 65%.

It is aesthetically pleasing, and a decorative material used by many architects, as well as plays an important role in the economy of India. Most of the marble processing activities are performed by small and medium scale industries (SMEs) not only in India but worldwide. These industries have low efficiency and productivity due to lack of new technologies, high productivity cost and a lack of proper sustainable waste management systems, thereby increasing the waste generated during the processing stage. There is a significant need within the sector for increasing production efficiency, combined with the need of a substantial reduction in waste generated that can be achieved by endorsing technological innovations. This is in addition to following best available processing practices, incorporating energy saving technologies and modernizing the sectors management and organization structure which will substantially increase efficiency as well as production. This article provides a systematic approach for assessing the current energy and present environment status of a typical SME processing units of Rajasthan area, and proposes measures for meeting cleaner production principles. An evaluation methodology was developed considering the realistic plant operation scenarios. The total energy inputs for processing the products with their appropriate environmental indices like CO2 emissions were calculated. Alternatively, the CO2 emissions were also calculated by Gabi educational software for different industries and the best way of reducing the energy consumption is suggested by following alternate source of energy.

A synchronised bus voltage balance (SBVB) technique is used to reduce the conduction losses and increase the soft switching operation range of the converters.

The finite element analysis is conducted on modal shape, the displacement, the mechanical energy, and the strain for both the linear and nonlinear U-VPEH models. Mathematical governing equations are derived to investigate dynamic characteristics of the model. The harmonic balance method and state space form are utilized to conduct the analytical and theoretical analysis. The results show that the first and second eigenfrequencies are 17.167 Hz and 22.951 Hz for the nonlinear U-VPEH model while those are only 17.366 Hz and 25.124 Hz for the linear model. The nonlinear energy harvester model can narrow frequency band gap between the first two resonance modes. Moreover, the maximum voltage response is 8.743 V@16.5 Hz under the up-sweeping signals while the maximum voltage response is 14.18 V@15.41 Hz under the down-sweeping signals. The experimental results demonstrate that the voltage response and the resonance frequency of the U-VPEH agree with the analytical and theoretical analysis. The nonlinear horizontal asymmetric U-VPEH model exhibits a good performance on the energy transfer.

Some studies have been reported in recent past on recycling of thermoplastics via three-dimensional (3D) printing as a novel technique under primary and secondary recycling. But hitherto no work has been reported on use of recycled/virgin thermoplastics for use as energy storage devices (ESD). In this paper an effort has been made to develop in house ESD in form of dry cell by printing with low cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based commercial open source 3D printer. The feed stock filament of FDM has been prepared by twin screw extrusion (TSE) comprising of advanced composite materials (thermoplastic: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix, reinforced with different proportions of chemicals/salts namely: MnO2, ZnCl2, NH4Cl and graphite), which has been used to print dry cell for energy storage applications. The commercial dry cell consists of four zones/sections and feed stock filaments for three zones have been prepared separately on TSE (with different proportions of ABS and reinforcement of chemical/salts) and fourth zone (of Zn metal) has been casted with conventional sand casting route. Finally, all four zones have been assembled in series to develop fully functional prototype of ESD. This study highlights that with the proposed methodology, dry cell comprising of minimum 40% by weight recycled thermoplastics can be prepared successfully having voltage potential at par with commercial dry cell. Another major advantage of using this novel route is that the ESD prepared is more thermally stable (confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis) and can operate up to 95 °C temperature. Along with this the ESD so prepared has better rheological, mechanical properties (tensile, surface hardness) ensuring it to be useable under severe loading conditions.

In this work, a series of novel Ba2LaNbO6 (BLN):Mn4+,Yb3+ phosphors for plant-cultivation light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were successfully synthesized through a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The emission peak of Mn4+ centered at 677 nm matched the red light emission required for phototropism well, while that of Yb3+ centered at 998 nm matched the far-red light emission required for photomorphogenesis. SEM images of the BLN:Mn4+,Yb3+ phosphors developed in this study showed that the samples were composed of micron-sized particles that can be coated onto LED chips. The photoluminescence excitation spectra of the phosphors showed broad bands from 250 nm to 550 nm, matching those of LED chips well. The activation energy of Mn4+ in the BLN:Mn4+ phosphor was calculated to be approximately 0.462 eV, thus confirming the good thermal stability of the material. The CCT, CRI, and luminous efficiency of a developed LED were 4021 K, 76.8, and 38 Im/W, respectively. Analysis of fluorescence lifetimes proved the occurrence of energy transfer between Mn4+ and Yb3+, and the intensity ratio of far-red and near-infrared emissions could be controlled by adjusting the doping ratio of Mn4+ and Yb3+ to meet the requirements of different plants.

The EMS is connected to a smart grid where the price signals indirectly control the power output of the PV/battery system in response to the demand variation of the electricity networks. The objective of the EMS is to maximize the revenue over a given time period while meeting the battery stored energy constraint. The optimization problem is solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The uniqueness of the proposed EMS remains in the reactive real-time control mechanism that compensates for the PV power forecast error. The proposed EMS requires only forecasting the average PV power output over the total optimization period. This is in contrast to the predictive power scheduling techniques that require accurate instantaneous PV power forecast. The proposed EMS method is verified by benchmarking against the predictive brute-force dynamic programming (DP) approach.

The model can perform an efficient prediction of the melt pool dimension, wetting angle, dilution, process heating/cooling rates and clad 3D profiles from single-track to multi-track and multi-layer deposition, and has the potential to be employed for the fast process optimization and controller design. The novelty of the model lies in three fronts: (1) the melt pool geometry variation as the liquid melt pool bead spreading on the solid surface is counted by the wetting angle alternation, in which the dynamic wetting angle is computed based on the Hoffman-Voinov-Tanner law; (2) the heat accumulation effect in the multi-track, multi-layer scanning is compensated by adding the accumulated temperature field to the initial temperature field of the following layers/tracks. The accumulated temperature is calculated by summing up the transient temperature solutions of the prior layers/tracks based on the superposition principle; and (3) the feeding powder distribution is incorporated into the transient thermal field simulation of the multi-layer and multi-track deposition process by analytically coupling the powder mass flows and laser heat flux, in which the powder mass flow is expressed as an equivalent heat flux. Experiments were conducted to validate the built model. The single-track measurements (clad height, clad width, dilution and wetting angle) show that the prediction error of the built model is less than 14%. The multi-track and multi-layer measurements also indicate that the model can perform a high accuracy dimension prediction of the built features. Besides, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the built model and the results show that the powder feed rate is the most sensitive parameter that substantially varies the clad height, followed by the process speed, whereas the specific heat has the least sensitivity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Clad geometry; Laser direct energy deposition",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053286385

The formulation is based on the assumptions including equivalent segmented non-tapered single-cell tubes as well as a parallel resisting force of the contributors (non-filled tubes, foam-filler, and interaction effects).

Shavadan design structure, the main strategy of architects and building construction practitioners in the past, plays an important role to increase the indoor thermal comfort of buildings in hot and humid climates.

We review the literature from the perspective of Science and Technology Studies (STS) to examine the experimental evidence and argumentative reasoning constituting three main explanations for how wind turbines impact health: 1) Exposure to infrasound directly causes adverse physiological effects, 2) Exposure to audible noise is associated with annoyance and sleep disturbance, and 3) Psychogenic factors act as mediators to adverse effects. In addition to technical and pragmatic arguments, the debate consists of value-based arguments about the desirability of wind energy, how precautionary development should be, what counts as a valid health issue in public policy, and what counts as valid evidence in health research. Thus, it encompasses the conflicting social commitments and environmental priorities of the wider wind energy debate and the politics of evidence in the health sciences. It suggests the controversy is unlikely to be settled by science but that an STS perspective can provide insights to foster governance that more effectively addresses the complexity of health issues in wind energy transitions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Human health; Rhetorical analysis; Science and technology studies; Wind energy",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053839040

The rock spallation temperature and degree of heterogeneity are two important parameters for spallation studies. The rock spallation temperature can offer guidance to provide a suitable temperature environment for different formations, and the degree of heterogeneity plays an important role in determining the spallability of rock. However, it is difficult to measure the rock's surface temperature at the onset of initial spallation and there is no universal method to determine the degree of heterogeneity of rock. This paper intends to provide a convenient analytical approach to approximate the rock spallation temperature and degree of heterogeneity for field applications. Based on the Weibull statistical theory of tensile failure, the rock temperature at spallation can be obtained by solving a set of over-determined equations. All other rock properties can be calculated based on the temperature, and then the degree of heterogeneity of rock can be determined. Compared with experimental data, the calculated rock spallation temperature and degree of heterogeneity are all within acceptable ranges.

The three analysis scenarios assume VG provides 55% of the electricity demand in the largely isolated Electricity Reliability Council of Texas grid system in 2050, with three different proportions of wind and solar generation. Across the three scenarios, 11%–16% of VG energy is curtailed without storage due to system-generation constraints. When 8.5 GW of storage capacity with 4 h of duration are added, curtailment is reduced to 8%–10% of VG. Additional storage duration further reduces curtailment, but with rapidly diminishing returns. At least half the potential avoided-curtailment benefits are realized with 8 h of storage, and the first 4 h provide the largest benefit.

The ability of enabling an instant temporary wireless networking scenario in situations like flooding and defense made MANET a prominent domain of research. Although, it has been extensively studied with respect to different means of issues including network security, power consumption issues etc. but the core findings in the area of security were found mostly limited to theoretical contributions. Moreover, An intrusion detection systems (IDS) enable different procedures involved into monitoring the activities being exercised in a MANET whether; it poses any suspicious or malicious events that could be harmful for the entire system. The conventional IDS models are more likely to consume higher level of energy which minimizes the network lifetime owing to rapid depletion of node’s battery power.

It also incorporated a technique which relates probabilistic theory of optimization to bring an effective cooperation among IDSs and neighbor nodes which leads to reduce their individual busy time.

The pathology of the neuromuscular control system in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (SDCP) could contribute to atypical movement patterns leading to the inefficiency performance including the STS task. However, there was also a lack of evidence about kinematics, kinetics, and especially mechanical work during the STS task in children with SDCP aged 7–12 years old. Research question: What were the differences in mechanical work, kinematics and kinetics during STS task between children with SDCP and typically developing (TD) children? Methods: Eleven children with SDCP (GMFCS I-II) and eleven age and gender-matched control TD children with an age range of 7–12 years were enrolled. Motion analysis and force plate systems were used to collect data. All participants performed the STS task from an adjustable chair. Independent sample t-test and two-way analysis of variance were used in this study. Results: The children with SDCP took a longer time and used more mechanical work during STS than TD children. At the beginning of the STS task, children with SDCP showed more trunk flexion and posterior pelvic tilting; in addition, during the STS task they also presented more trunk, hip, and knee flexion than TD children. However, the children with SDCP showed less ankle dorsiflexion compared with TD children. For the kinetic variables, asymmetry was found in children with SDCP. The maximum hip and knee extension moment, plantar flexion moment, and peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF) of the non-dominant leg were higher than the values of the dominant leg in these children. Significance: Even though, children with SDCP who are able to independently STS. They were also a mechanically less efficient performance during STS task. Therefore, this task still needs to be trained during rehabilitation sessions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cerebral palsy; Children; Kinematics; Kinetics; Mechanical energy; Sit-to-stand",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054189164

Reducing the differences in regional energy efficiency has become an urgent energy issue in China. The constant absorption of foreign direct investment (FDI) has brought advanced technologies to China, which has an important impact on China's energy efficiency. To explore whether FDI can reduce regional energy efficiency differences, this paper investigates the existence of energy intensity convergence while incorporating foreign direct investment (FDI). Since existing research on regional energy intensity convergence lacks of consideration of the data spatial dependence, we focus on spatial econometric model to test energy intensity convergence. We use panel data of 30 provinces in China over the period of 2005–2014 to test energy intensity convergence by β convergence model. The empirical results show that considering the spatial dependence of the data, FDI can promote the formation of conditional energy intensity convergence. Further analysis found that the spillover effect of FDI plays an important role in this formation. In addition, the convergence speed accelerates after considering the spatial dependence. Finally, the spillover effect of FDI, which is global, inhibits the declining speed of energy intensity during the research period. The scale effect of FDI and energy rebound effect plays an important role in the effect of FDI on energy intensity. These results show that guiding foreign investment more reasonably in each province in China can make contributions to the reduction of energy efficiency differences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy intensity; FDI; Spatial econometric model; Spillover effect",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054185659

Significant reduction of onset and main dehydrogenation temperatures of MgH2 (ΔT = 243 and 158 °C, respectively) are achieved by doping with 5–10 wt % of NbF5, ACNF-TiF4 and ACNF-NbF5.

Various input factors were explored (energy demand and previous price) with different combinations to observe which factors, if any, had an impact on the current price prediction. The results show that the generated NARMAX model is good at describing the input-output relationship of energy prices.

Justification: There is not, from a legal, labor or engineering point of view, a standard that indicates the amount of work a pregnant woman can do or the number of breaks she may need. Currently, Mexican legislation indicates that a pregnant woman must perform a “LIGHT” job, leaving this term open to various interpretations. When we determine the PCW in pregnant women, we can assign them the workload they can develop depending on their age and gestation period, in other words, assign pregnant women to an adequate workstation. Methodology: 1.Make a study of each of the women participating in the project to determine their health status.2.Calculate the Energy Metabolic Expenditure (EME) of each of the stations assigned to pregnant women with the method proposed by Bernad and Joseph [1].3.Perform a measurement of oxygen consumption in pregnant women with the VO2000® equipment while performing its activity in the assigned work station (Estimated maximum time: 60 min). Description of the Study: Phase I: The study was developed with 17 pregnant women who were in different periods of gestation. Phase II: The study was repeated with 5 of these 17 women who changed their gestation period of 1–2 or 2–3. Each woman performed a test for a minimum period of 30 min with VO2000® and determined the oxygen consumption and the corresponding Kcal/min. Total number of observations: 22. Phase III: Age, period and weeks of gestation, previous births, and EME in Kcal/min were considered as input variables. Results: With the data obtained, we determined the equation to predict the energy consumption in pregnant women by means of multiple linear regression analysis in the following way: (Formula Presented) The model has a coefficient of determination 54%, which means that the variation can be explained by the variables considered only 54%. Conclusions: 1.It is feasible to develop a method to determine the energy consumption in pregnant women working in a manufacturing environment.2.We can now have a more confident idea of how we should assign pregnant women to workstations that are appropriate according to their pregnancy weeks.3.Although the current model is “good”, more observations are needed to make it more robust under these considerations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Energy metabolic expenditure; Physical work capacity; Pregnant women",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052321610

Recent success in reducing operational energy and the introduction of strict targets for near-zero energy buildings mean that embodied energy is becoming the dominant component of whole life energy consumption in buildings. One strategy that may be key to achieving emissions reductions is to use materials as efficiently as possible. Yet research has shown that real buildings use structural material inefficiently, with wastage in the order of 50% being common. Two plausible mechanisms are 1) that some engineers hold individual misconceptions, or 2) that inefficiency is a cultural phenomenon, whereby engineers automatically and unquestioningly repeat previous methods without assessing their true suitability. This paper presents a survey of 129 engineering practitioners that examined both culture and practice in design relating to material efficiency. The results reveal wide variations and uncertainty in both regulated and cultural behaviours. For the first time, we demonstrate that embodied energy efficiency is not a high priority, with habitual over-design resulting in more expensive buildings that consume more of our material resource than necessary. We show wide variability in measures that engineers should agree on and propose research through which these culture and individual issues might fruitfully be tackled within the timeframes required by climate science. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Design methods; Efficiency; Embodied energy; Material utilisation; Structural design",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053803255

The walking is performed in the sagittal plane. The period of the walking gait is the stride that is composed of single support (SS) phase on the first leg, an instantaneous double support (DS) phase, a SS phase on the other leg and another instantaneous DS phase. The stride is the period of this cyclic walking, because the motion of coupled arms is synchronized on this stride. The cane is considered massless. Thus, in order to compare the walking with and without massless cane, the same dynamic model is considered. Numerical tests show that the magnitude of the ground reaction in the stance foot is less with a massless-cane assistance than without one. Especially, the results prove that it is better to use canes with a handle that allows to apply on it a force and a moment by the user.

A simple lowering of mixing temperature can reduce the workability and the compactability of asphalt mixture. So, several techniques such as additivation and foaming are proposed to avoid or reduce this laying issue. The shear gyratory compactor (GC) conventionally evaluates the compactability but different approaches can be used to analyse data. This paper aims to assess the relevance of these methods by an experimental program conducted on two WMA (with EVOTHERM® technology WM30 additive developed by Ingevity and foam process) compared with a conventional hot mix asphalt (HMA), at three compaction temperatures. The classic exploitation of GC’s data (i.e. considering the void content at a given number of gyrations) is not relevant to evaluate the effect of the decrease in temperature on the compactability. The calculation of compactability indices (CEI), used to obtain a level of compaction (90%, 92%, and 95%), is interesting but takes more time. The calculation of performance ratios is the simplest and most relevant approach. The use of liquid additive seems the most promising towards the compactability. © 2019, RILEM.","Compactability; Compaction energy; Gyratory compaction; Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA)",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053429868

This article assesses the potentially available amount of methane from the existing plant stock within an Austrian region.

Despite the higher production costs when compared to natural gas, expanding the domestic production capacity of renewable gas can be advantageous. Due to the regional increase in value-added, revenues resulting from the production of methane provide valuable income, especially in economically lagging regions.

This paper focuses on various schemes for enhancing the network lifetime through an analytical approach. Methods An analytical model for enhanced lifetime of sensor nodes is proposed. The proposed model consists of both relay nodes (RN) and sensor nodes (SN) towards enhancing the longevity of network lifetime. The routing protocol is designed to collect the sensed information from SN by adapting optimal path towards gateway. The optimal distance between SN and RN is chosen based on best quality link which ensures the packet delivery. The total installation cost of RN, the total energy consumption of both RN and SN, the traffic serviced from all sensors and data routing to nodes are the constraints considered in the proposed framework for achieving the optimal path though efficient relaying. Results The proposed multi-tier telemedicine system is extensively simulated for describing the optimal network path for MBAN-based e-health services. The proposed work is modelled using integer linear programming that optimizes the location and number of relays. Relays are deployed for minimizing the cost of network installation of RN. The energy which is consumed by both sensors and relays is minimized while ensuring full coverage with effective routing of e-health services.

Gas expansion energy is a major factor in outburst initiation. However, the amount of coal gas participating in outburst initiation is hard to estimate. In this study, considering the effect of coal damage and the environmental pressure change for desorption, a method to calculate gas expansion energy for outburst initiation is provided. Due to the reduction of the diffusion path, new fractures caused by coal damage can obviously affect gas expansion energy during outburst initiation. A peak zone of gas expansion energy during outburst initiation exists in front of the working face that belongs to the failure zone in coal mining and the zone of high gas pressure gradient. The peak zone is the risk source of the outburst and is the reason for the slabbing characteristic of the outburst. In outburst initiation, the variable pressure environment for gas desorption from the coal matrix has a limited effect on gas expansion energy for the outburst. Thus, the approximation of gas desorption with atmospheric pressure in the previous gas energy calculation is practicable. Gas conditions can affect the gas distribution in a coal mass and then obviously affect the gas expansion energy for an outburst initiation. Meanwhile, fracture development or the sorption time of the coal matrix has an obvious effect as well. It means tectonic coal could contribute much more gas expansion energy than primary-structure coal, causing high frequency and large power outbursts in tectonic regions. Unlike the effect on elastic energy accumulated in the coal mass, the increase of coal seam depth only broadens the peak zone of gas expansion energy and has little effect on the peak magnitude. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coal and gas outburst; Coal damage; Gas expansion energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051490093

As such, eco-drivers have an impact on fuel efficiency when selecting a vehicle (strategic eco-driving), selecting routes (tactical eco-driving) as well as selecting eco-driving strategies (operational eco-driving). On the operational level, a key task for electric vehicle drivers is to decide how to control and interact with the system-inherent energy flows (i.e., user-energy interaction). With the control of the energy flows, drivers convert energies into each other with the goal of achieving optimal energy efficiency. Consequently, user-energy interaction can be regarded as a regulation of energy resources that is composed of a series of economic decisions. Therefore, we examine economic decision-making as a framework for understanding drivers’ eco-driving decisions on the strategic, tactical and operational level of eco-driving. So far economic decision-making has been most extensively studied with the resource money creating a whole research discipline, namely behavioral economics. A plethora of research has indicated that humans tend to use heuristics and succumb to fallacies when making economic decisions. Therefore, we describe heuristics and biases that have been identified for driver behavior and that are relevant to eco-driving. Based on these, we discuss possible implications of the behavioral economics perspective for user-energy interaction. Opportunities to support drivers’ user-energy interaction on the levels of eco-driving and directions for future research are highlighted. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behavioral economics; Biases; Eco-driving; Heuristics; User-energy interaction",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052156266

The solid state transformer (SST) promises to be one of the most significant power electronically-interfaced devices to be integrated in the next generation distribution network due to its extensive energy management capability to handle interconnected AC and DC source(s) and load(s). In this paper, a three-phase unbalanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithm is extended for integrating distributed energy resources (DER) and SSTs in the future distribution networks. The purpose of the OPF is to optimize the economic operations of DERs in conjunction with the SST to improve system efficiency and voltage profiles, while controlling DER penetration. The topology and functionalities of the SST are introduced and modeled in the OPF algorithm. Comprehensive models of loads, conductors, voltage regulators, transformers, and pricing schemes are considered for accuracy. Based on the theoretical foundations, simulations are conducted on the IEEE 123 bus test system. The entire algorithm is also visualized in a quasi-static time-series (QSTS) manner to capture the variability of the system and response of the SSTs in different control modes.

In this paper, energy-efficient task scheduling is studied when static power consumption is a significant part of energy consumption which cannot be ignored. The problems of scheduling a set of independent sequential tasks on identical processors so that the schedule length is minimized for a given energy consumption constraint or the energy consumption is minimized for a given schedule length constraint are investigated. For a given schedule, the optimal task execution speed setting for delay and energy minimization is found analytically. Lower bounds for the minimum schedule length of a set of tasks with a given energy consumption constraint and the minimum energy consumption of a set of tasks with a given schedule length constraint are established. Our lower bounds are applicable to sequential or parallel, and independent or precedence constrained tasks, on processors with discrete or continuous speed levels, and bounded or unbounded speed ranges. The significance of these lower bounds is that they can be used to evaluate the performance of any heuristic algorithms when compared with optimal algorithms. Experimental study on the performance of list scheduling algorithms is performed and it is shown that their performance is very close to the optimal.

Retired oil and gas platforms could be redeployed for alternate uses such as CO2 capture and storage, renewable wind energy, and sustainable fisheries and employ citizens in coastal areas. Elsewhere around the world, offshore platforms are used for purposes other than producing oil and gas. U.S. Federal legislation (Energy Policy Act 2005 Section 388 of Public Law [PL] 109-58); 30 CFR 285.1000 Subpart J) authorizes the use of retired oil and gas platforms for alternate uses.

We examined the socio-economic incentives, environmental impacts, and regulatory issues associated with the alternate uses. We suggest that CO2-EOR is the most economically efficient way to store CO2 offshore and that offshore wind turbines may assist with the energy requirements for oil and gas production and CO2-EOR. Data suggest that in our study area offshore platforms are more successful at producing fish and invertebrates if they are left standing instead of toppled over. The greatest regulatory issue facing the use of retired platforms is the transfer of liability.

To guarantee a reliable electricity production using this renewable source of energy, concentrated solar power (CSP) plants are coupled with thermal energy storage (TES) technology. This combination is advantageous thanks to the low cost of TES compared to other storage methods (e.g. electrochemical storage). Heat can be stored in a sensible, latent or thermochemical form. Compared to sensible heat storage, which is the most mature TES technology, latent heat storage (LHS) enables higher storage energy density with a smaller temperature change. However, the application of phase change materials (PCM) as storage media for LHS systems is stained with the drawbacks of their low thermal conductivity. In this work, a review of the recent advances of LHS systems is conducted with an emphasis on the enhancement methods of PCMs thermal conductivity. Moreover, based on the previous literature review a selection methodology of suitable PCMs for medium temperature applications (100–300 °C) is described.

Specifically, the Forward Euler (FE) integration is found ill-suited for all the trial applications due to the outdated velocity update; the Velocity Verlet (VV) integration shows robust convergence and superior efficiency, but loses the ability of critical analysis; the Semi-implicit Euler (SE) integration endows the FIRE method with the critical analysis ability as well as good efficiency, but its convergence is conditional.

It is based on the idea that compensatory mutations at specific residue positions in a sequence help preserve stability of protein architecture and function and leave a statistical signature related to residue-residue interactions in the 3D structure of the protein. Consequently, statistical analysis of these correlated mutations in subsets of protein sequence alignments can be used to predict which residue pairs should be in spatial proximity in the native functional protein fold. These predicted signals can be then used to guide molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the three-dimensional coordinates of a functional amino acid chain. In this chapter, we introduce a general and efficient methodology to perform coevolutionary analysis on protein sequences and to use this information in combination with computational physical models to predict the native 3D conformation of functional polypeptides. We present a step-by-step methodology that includes the description and application of software tools and databases required to infer tertiary structures of a protein fold.

However, Smart City projects involving the refurbishment of existing buildings carry key barriers to implementation. The most prominent ones are: (i) a wide time discrepancy between appreciable environmental and economic benefits and immediate costs of action and (ii) economic benefits that might not accrue to who bears the cost of the intervention. This research provides a clue to solving this impasse based on the concept of multiple-benefits evaluation stemming from a shift in perspective from mitigation costs to development opportunities. We considered the costs of interventions on the European building stock under the Smart City projects to assess the multiple-benefits delivered to society. Starting from the monetary aspects of single projects, we identified multipliers to assess three different types of multiple-benefits: (i) Energy savings; (ii) Health and well-being; and iii.) Employment. Our findings indicate that in a time span of 14 years (2005–2018), an amount of about 260 million Euros invested in such projects lead to: (i) an accumulated saving potential of approximately 40 kilotons of oil equivalent, corresponding to 465 GWh; (ii) a reduction in air pollution corresponding to a value of 3 million Euros in avoided costs; and (iii) the creation of around 1,000 jobs with an average duration of 5 years. Considering that most of such investments occurred during the latest economic recession, the impact of the aforementioned multi-benefits appears to be not negligible. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Deep energy retrofits; European building stock; Multiple-benefits; Smart city projects",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047967427

Despite being ubiquitously present, harvesting it presents a major challenge, owing to the limited efficiency of solar array cells. One of the ways to enhance the efficiency of solar panels, as well as mitigating cost is the use of solar tracker. A tracking mechanism moves and positions the solar array, so as to achieve maximum power output. While a tracker can be either a single axis or dual axis. This paper aims to demonstrate the design and construction of a prototype for dual axis solar tracking system. Dual axis trackers have obvious advantages over single axis trackers. Dual axis trackers have two degrees of freedom which facilitates it to track sunlight with precision from both the axes. This improves the overall efficiency of the tracking mechanism. Dual axis trackers are also the best options for places where the position of the sun keeps changing throughout the year at different seasons. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Dual axis tracker; Single axis tracker; Solar energy; Solar panels; Solar tracking",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051701548

This helps to assess the feasibility of incineration of MSW and ascertain the sustainability of the waste management scheme.

Water insoluble salts can be synthesized from the potassium or sodium salts by a simple metathesis reaction with the corresponding halide of the desired organic cation. Water soluble salts can be prepared via two consecutive metathesis reactions: the halide is first converted to the corresponding sulfate, which is reacted in turn with barium dodecahydroborate, yielding the water soluble organic closo(B12H12)2− salt and the insoluble BaSO4.

Developing green IoT is a difficult task because IoT has more devices and has complex structure, so most of the current schemes for deploying nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) cannot be applied directly in IoT. In this paper, we propose a scheme which gives an energy-efficient IoT. Here, we propose two schemes for framework structure of a network, and then we propose clustering algorithms and routing algorithms for network formation which is based on minimum spanning tree. After numerous simulations, we show that these schemes result in minimal energy consumption and enhance the network lifetime. Thus, the proposed schemes are more energy-efficient compared to a typical WSN deployment scheme; hence, these schemes are applicable to the green IoT deployment. We show that in the proposed schemes, the nodes are alive for more number of rounds as compared to the existing algorithms. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Clustering; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Minimum spanning tree; Steiner tree; Wireless sensor networks",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049924022

At the upper-level of the Stackelberg game, the aggregator optimizes his daily price profile so as to reach a net targeted profit which is the maximum value guaranteeing that no consumer will leave the coalition - to contract with a conventional retailer considered here as a fixed alternative - while meeting fairness criterion imposed by the cost-sharing mechanism. At the lower-level, the consumers are asked to provide in day ahead an estimate of their base load hourly demand profile and to schedule their shiftable loads depending on the price signal sent by the aggregator. We provide algorithms that determine the unique price profile and consumer shiftable load schedules as functions of the reservation price estimates. The Stackelberg game between the aggregator and the consumers being repeated for a period of time, the aggregator has the possibility to update his estimates of the reservation prices relying on a feedback function which depends on the percentage of activated loads. A randomized algorithm for consumers’ reservation price learning based on regret minimization is provided. For four cost-sharing mechanisms such as uniform allocation, stand-alone cost, Shapley value, separable and non-separable costs, we determine the closed form of the aggregator's optimal net targeted profit guaranteeing the stability of the coalition. We also determine conditions guaranteeing the core non-emptiness and prove that for a profit-maximizing aggregator, the stand-alone cost is always preferable to the Shapley value, which coincides with the uniform allocation. Furthermore, the optimal size of the coalition - in terms of the aggregator's profit - can be determined analytically when the Shapley value is implemented as cost-sharing mechanism. The results are illustrated on a case study where we show that there exists an optimal net targeted profit below which the consumers energy bill is lower when joining the aggregator than with the conventional retailer. Coalition dynamics is also analyzed numerically depending on the consumer inertia in their energy supplier choice process, for each cost-sharing mechanism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coalition formation; Forecast algorithm; Game theory; Load scheduling; OR in energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049469341

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as a promising polymeric photocatalyst, and its highly tunable properties allow the material with an enhanced photocatalytic activity for environmental remediation. In this study, by taking advantage of simulation and experimental tools, we systematically evaluated the production of reactive species of undoped and carbon (C)-doped g-C3N4 samples, and identify the role of these species in contaminant oxidation under simulated visible sunlight irradiation (xenon lamp, λ &gt; 400 nm). Both g-C3N4 samples produced negligible [rad]OH or triplet-excited states (3g-C3N4*), but the C-doped g-C3N4 sample generated more 1O2, O2 − [rad], and H2O2 compared to the undoped counterpart. Surprisingly, all these oxidative species did not contribute substantially for the degradation kinetics of contaminant phenol and atrazine, at least for the initial oxidation of the parent compounds; and the results otherwise highlighted the important role of the holes for contaminant transformation. The surface-mediated hole oxidation of the contaminants, including the adsorption of the contaminants on the photocatalyst surface (quantified by the binding free energy) and electron transfer kinetics from the contaminants to the excited photocatalysts (quantified by the concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (CPCET) rate) were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The simulation results indicated that C-doping could favor the binding of atrazine but not of phenol on g-C3N4. The C-doping also significantly decreased the CPCET rate of phenol on g-C3N4 but could have little to no adverse impact for the CPCET rate of atrazine. These simulation and experimental results could explain the selective oxidation of phenol and atrazine on undoped and C-doped g-C3N4 in our previous study, and the results also highlight the dominant role of the holes for contaminant transformation that was largely overlooked before. This study generates mechanistic insights of photocatalytic oxidation, and will provide guidelines for the rational design of g-C3N4 as an effective visible-light-responsive photocatalyst for many applications, including contaminant degradation, chemical synthesis, and beyond. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Binding energy; Concerted proton-coupled electron transfer (CPCET); Graphitic carbon nitride; Hole oxidation; Photocatalysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053032337

The maximal ratio transmission protocol is applied at the multi-antenna source such that the wireless signals are designated to the destination directly. Besides, the energy harvesting and full-duplex self-jamming operations are adopted at the energy-constrained destination to prolong its lifetime as well as to confuse the eavesdropper. Specifically, the exact and asymptotic closed-form expressions of the connection outage probability (COP), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the secrecy throughput of the proposed system are obtained, based on which we optimize the time-switching ratio to maximize the secrecy throughput. We also degenerate the proposed SWIPT-FDSJ scheme to the reduced half-duplex with no self-jamming (HDNSJ) scheme. The finds suggest that in the HDNSJ scheme, adding the antenna number of the source only benefits the COP performance, but has no impact on the SOP performance. By contrast, it will promote the COP and SOP performance at the same time in the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme, which eventually results in the great improvement of secrecy throughput. In addition, we present the practical application condition of the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme. It is demonstrated that the secrecy throughput performance of the SWIPT-FDSJ scheme is much superior to the HDNSJ scheme on condition that the application condition is satisfied. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; maximum secrecy throughput; optimal application condition; secrecy outage probability; time-switching ratio",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048632263

The convergence as well as an error estimate in time is proved. The analytical solution associated with a benchmark problem is introduced and it is compared to approximate solutions for different choices of mass redistribution.

It is sometimes classified as waste even if this definition is wrong in most of the cases where the BL is reutilized (recovered) by using it as fuel in recovery boilers. In this process, the pulping chemicals are recovered and sent again to the cooking process of wood. BL has more than half of the energy content of the inlet wood. KBL is generally used as an energy source although recovery boilers are still quite thermally inefficient compared to coal or gas fired power producing ones. Among the various solutions, supercritical water gasification (SCWG) enables bio-fuels and value products to be obtained from KBL. The present study deals with the KBL SCWG by using a plug-flow reactor operating continuously at 250 bar pressure and variable temperatures in the range 500–700 °C. The objective was to identify the experimental conditions that lead to the development of operational problems and to document them accurately. In this study, real time visualization of online measurements has been conducted by means of the LabView software. In order to highlight the differences in behavior, tests were conducted on two different substrates, the sucrose and KBL. Results highlight how tests were carried out without problems at 500 °C resulting in a total gas yield of 18.31 g-mol/kgfeed, consisting mainly of H2 (7.87 g-mol/kgfeed), CO2 (5.84 g-mol/kgfeed), H2S (2.29 g-mol/kgfeed) and CH4 (1.96 g-mol/kgfeed). On the contrary, in the case of KBL SCWG the test was interrupted at 600 °C because of salt deposits and consequent clogging in the entrance of the reactor. The LabView software showed particularly rapid pressure drops which were not addressed to technical problems in the layout. However, the recording of the pressure drop was only the final symptom of this occurrence. The saline content in the investigated inlet KBL also suggested the need of a pre-treatment for the removal of the inlet salts in the case where a non-catalytic reactor would be used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clogging; Continuous experimentation; Energy recovery; Pulp and paper industry; Sucrose; Waste valorisation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051811829

In this study, a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS based) metabolomics approach was used along with flow cytometry to characterize the responses of clams during aerial exposure in two different storage conditions (ice and no ice) and storage periods (1 h and 6 h). The results showed a significant increase in haemocyte mortality and ROS production in clams exposed to room temperature (no ice) and after 6 h compared to low temperature (with ice) and 1 h, respectively. The metabolite profiles of clam haemolymph in all groups revealed changes of many metabolites between the different temperatures and sampling times. Among them, lactic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid and glutamic acid were identified as significantly affected by both storage condition and period. These results indicate that clam storage stresses produced biological disturbances related to energy metabolism, which was switched from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. These findings provide insights regarding the specific metabolic consequences of bivalve live storage and transport, which may lead to improved product handling along the supply chain.

This study conducted a pilot-scale operation using an enhanced membrane-based pre-concentration (MPC) technique to efficiently recover organics from actual MW. Stable and highly efficient organics recovery (72–75%) was achieved during two-month operations. Concentrated organics demonstrated high COD (above 20,000 mg/L) and good anaerobic biodegradability (360–367 mL CH4/g VS). Organics recovered by MPC exhibited the potential of net electrical energy production of 0.029–0.050 kWh/m3, depending on the fouling situation. The energy consumption of MPC was limited by avoiding continuous intensive aeration. With effective fouling control, as much as 2.91 times more energy could be produced than that was consumed.

This paper aims to formulate, analyze and clarify the role of merchant-owned BSUs in the day-ahead electricity market. It defines virtual storage plant (VSP) as a set of BSUs distributed across the network. A VSP offering model is formulated as a bilevel program in which the upper-level problem represents the VSP profit maximization and operation, while the lower-level problem simulates market clearing and price formation. This mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) is converted into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This is afterwards expanded to a game of multiple VSPs formulating an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints (EPEC), which is solved using the diagonalization procedure. The proposed model is applied to an updated IEEE RTS-96 system. We evaluate the impact VSPs have on the locational marginal prices and compare the coordinated approach (all BSUs operated under a single VSP), i.e. the MPEC formulation, to the competitive approach (multiple VSPs competing for profit), i.e. the EPEC formulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bilevel programming; Energy storage; Mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints; Virtual storage plant",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050136165

Electrical utilities have met the state's energy goals using a combination of wind, hydroelectric, and solar power, while giving relatively little consideration to biogas generated from domestic wastewater treatment (i.e., biomass accounts for &lt; 0.1% of renewable energy used in Colorado). An examination of wastewater treatment facilities designed to treat flowrates &gt;7570 m3d-1 indicates that energy generated from the anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge and combined heat and power technologies is limited in Colorado. At the time of this study, only 39% of examined facilities used anaerobic digestion and only 4 of 24 anaerobic digestion facilities actively employed combined heat and power. Barriers to widespread implementation of anaerobic digestion and combined heat and power were primarily associated with costs, e.g., infrastructure or equipment capital costs; however, other barriers were identified, including: effectiveness of available grant and loan programs, state-level regulations, electric utility rate structures, the influence of local decision-making authorities, and a reluctance by wastewater treatment facilities to change sludge digestion practices. To overcome these barriers, recommendations for the state of Colorado include: initiate a comprehensive program focused on promoting current incentives, review the efficacy of available incentive programs and make long-term modifications, enact regulatory updates, increase education and outreach, and establish a program to promote co-digestion of wastewater sludge with other organic waste streams. This state-level case study explores a large number of facilities at a granular level, the results of which may be relevant to other states or regions and can provide insight into barriers elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Barriers; Biogas; Combined heat and power; Domestic wastewater; Sustainable energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053835445

The study extends the typical unidirectional tests (in armchair and zigzag directions) to the bidirectional test and the shear test, establishing a consistent and comprehensive set of both elastic and strength properties. The mechanical properties obtained from the monotonic analyses (elastic and strength properties) are validated from the comparison with those available in the literature (experimental, density functional theory, molecular dynamic simulations and finite element models). The strain-softening behaviour of graphene is assessed through these atomistic models. The failure modes of graphene sheets in different loading tests are detailed and its load carrying capacity is explained. Finally, the hysteretic behaviour of graphene is discussed. The stress-strain curves and the variation of dissipated energy with the strain are given for different number of cycles.

It is considered to have a variety of power gird applications including providing reserve services. Although a number of studies are reported in the optimal scheduling strategy of using compressed air energy storage, very few studies have been reported in AA-CAES reserve capacity modelling. This paper presents a reserve capacity model for an AA-CAES facility considering its working mode conversion process, the dynamic characteristics, the air pressure limitations, the thermal storage capacity limitations and the power output limitations of AA-CAES. The developed reserve capacity model is then used in the power system optimal joint energy and reserve scheduling. In the scheduling, the limits on the reserve capacities of Thermal Power Units (TUs) and Interruptible Loads (ILs), which are caused by AA-CAES, are taken into account. The developed scheduling model are used to analyse the impacts of AA-CAES on the system energy and reserve schedules, the system operation costs and the wind curtailment. Numerical simulation results indicate that the participation of AA-CAES in power system operation does not only reduce the system energy and reserve costs, but also mitigate the wind curtailment. However, it is found that AA-CAES is unsuitable for undertaking the system reserve demand alone and using AA-CAES to provide reserve services may increase the system total reserve demand. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced adiabatic compressed air energy storage (AA-CAES); Optimization; Power system scheduling; Reserve capacity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049751874

The experimental results were analyzed in terms of bond stress-slip curve, bond strength ratio, and energy dissipation. Severe failures in the interfacial layers of the GFRP rebars at the resin-bar fiber interface was observed as cycling loads increased. The addition of structural fibers to concrete generally showed significant changes for debonding failure mechanism since the strong bonding resulted in reduced energy dissipation as well as a sharp increase of load in the bond stress-slip curve.

Each source eliminates its own signal from the relaying signal by self-cancellation and then decodes the data signal received from the other source. For this wireless-powered two-way relay system, we propose two secure relay protocols based on power splitting and time switching techniques. The two protocols are power splitting-based two-way relaying (PS-TWR) and time switching-based two-way relaying (TS-TWR), in which the relay, respectively, controls the power splitting ratio ( ρ ) and time switching ratio ( α ), in order to achieve a balance between the data receiving and the energy harvesting. The optimal values of ρ and α for each protocol are found analytically to maximize the minimum guaranteed secrecy capacity (CS-min) considering multiple eavesdroppers in high signal-to-noise ratio environments. Numerical results show that both the PS-TWR and TS-TWR protocols using the optimized values of ρ and α achieve the near-optimal CS -min no matter how many eavesdroppers exist anywhere. Comparisons of the two protocols in various scenarios also show that PS-TWR achieves better CS -min than TS-TWR because PS-TWR inherently has a shorter vulnerable time for eavesdropping than TS-TWR. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; physical layer security; power splitting; secrecy capacity; time switching; two-way relay",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048578030

The importance of using renewable energies is increasingly recognized all across the world yet they are not fully ready to compete with the mature and ancient technologies that use non-renewable energies. The economic characteristics of different energy technologies can be compared by using the method of levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). LCOE represents the total cost of a power plant including investment and operation and maintenance costs over the assumed life-cycle and discounted to account for the time-value of money. In this paper, an analysis of the levelized costs is proposed for two renewable technologies in Portugal: wind power and solar photovoltaic. Firstly, a deterministic value of LCOE was computed for both technologies. Secondly, recognizing the uncertainty associated with all the assumed parameters, a probabilistic risk analysis was conducted with Monte Carlo simulation to complement the analysis. The results show the high variability of the obtained LCOE values, largely influenced by the investment values and load factors. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE); Probabilistic risk analysis; Renewable energy sources",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048529263

In conditions of overweight and obesity the control of energy balance is clearly deregulated, and serotonergic modulation appears to make a significant contribution to weight gain. Fluoxetine (FLX), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that increases 5-HT availability in the synaptic cleft may thus have potential effects on energy balance. Our aim was to use an overfeeding model to investigate the effects of chronic FLX treatment on energy balance-related parameters regulated by hypothalamic neuropeptides. Nursing male Wistar rats were assigned to normofed (9 pups/dam) or overfed (3 pups/dam) groups beginning at 3 days of age and continuing until 21 days of age, when commercial chow and water were made available ad libitum until experimental treatments were begun. From 39 through 59 days of age groups were divided according to pharmacological treatment: 1) NV group, normofed + vehicle solution (NaCl 0.9%, 10 ml/kg b.w.), 2) NF group, normofed + FLX (10 mg/kg b.w., in vehicle solution, 10 ml/kg b.w.) 3), OV, overfed + vehicle solution and 4) OF, overfed + FLX. At 60 days of age, body weight, white and brown adipose tissue content, and food intake were determined, and serum biochemical parameters and hypothalamic neuropeptide gene expression were measured. Results showed that FLX induced reductions in several murinometric indices, improvement of adipose profile, hypophagic behavior, reduction in serum parameters, and positive modulation of hypophagia-related genes. These data suggest that the beneficial effects of FLX-treatment on overfeeding-induced physical and behavioral effects in rats was due to hypothalamic alterations that led to improvement in energy balance in animals with a compromised metabolism. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy balance; Food behavior; Hypothalamus; Overfeeding; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); Serotonin",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051783880

Fasting blood glucose is the current protocol for assessing metabolic impairment. However, recent studies have shown young adults may have normal fasting blood glucose levels with underlying irregularities in postprandial glucose regulation, insulin secretion and cortisol release, which causes a pattern of visceral fat accumulation. Visceral fat of the volunteers was assessed using the DXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) full body scanning method; the waist was assessed by taking the circumference at the midpoint between the lower margin of the last palpable rib and the top of the iliac crest to formulate a waist to height ratio (WHtR); fasting glucose levels were measured via point-of-care (POC) finger-stick method using the Abbott Precision blood glucose meter and anxiety levels.

This correlation between GAD-7 and VAT Volume and VAT Mass shows the physiological connection between elevated visceral fat and heightened anxiety.

The influences of ball-milling time on the phase distributions of milled powders and sintered bulks, the morphology of ball-milled powders, and superconducting properties of final sintered bulks were systematically studied. It was found that with increasing ball-milling time, the ball-milled powders changed from a crystal to a noncrystalline and then to an alloy. At the same time, the main phases in ball-milled powders changed from original mixed powders of Fe, Se, and Te to (Se, Te) solid solution, and then to the two phases of β-Fe(Se, Te) and δ -Fe(Se, Te), accordingly. Due to the reduction in diffusion length, it was more likely for HEBM powders to form FeSeTe ternary alloys. Thus, the obtained Fe(Se, Te) bulk with HEBM time of 4 h exhibited the highest Tc of 14.3 K and the largest content of superconducting phase.

In this study, a method for the online tracking of dominated oscillation paths and generator damping contribution during low-frequency oscillations is proposed on the basis of the damping loss factor (DLF) and two improved forms of power system energy structure (PSES). DLF in elasticity mechanics is introduced to quantitatively establish the relationship between dissipation energy and damping ratio for each mode.

The impact on CO2 emissions and a simple costs analysis were also carried out. It included a monitoring plan of 197 baths taken under different scenarios of water temperature and flow. It was concluded that increasing water consumption leads to an increase on energy consumption and that both resources consumptions increase with bath duration. Bath temperature had influence not only on energy consumption, as expected, but also in water consumption, what may be explained by the user's satisfaction during baths with higher temperatures. The use of a flow reducing valve is not a guarantee of water saving which can also be related to the user's satisfaction patterns, given that the introduction of a flow reducing valve can lead to a bath duration increase. In what concerns to the CO2 emissions, it was concluded, as expected, that higher values are obtained for baths with higher temperatures given their relation with higher energy consumptions patterns.

This has challenged the theoretical and computational approaches to polyatomic reaction dynamics in two major areas: the potential energy surface and the dynamics. Highly accurate potential energy surfaces are essential for achieving accurate dynamical information in quantum dynamics calculations. The increased number of degrees of freedom in larger systems poses a significant challenge to the accurate construction of potential energy surfaces. Recently, there has been substantial progress in the development of potential energy surfaces for polyatomic reactive systems. In this article, we review the recent developments made by our group in constructing highly accurately fitted potential energy surfaces for polyatomic reactive systems, based on a neural network approach. A key advantage of the neural network approach is its more faithful representation of the ab initio points. We recently proposed a systematic procedure, based on neural network fitting, for the construction of accurate potential energy surfaces with very small root mean square errors. Based on the neural network approach, we successfully developed potential energy surfaces for polyatomic reactions in the gas phase, including the reactive systems OH3, HOCO, and CH5, and the dissociation of gas-phase molecules on metal surfaces, such as H2O on the Cu(111) surface. These potential energy surfaces were fitted to an unprecedented level of accuracy, representing the most accurate potential energy surfaces calculated for these systems, and were rigorously tested using quantum dynamics calculations. The quantum dynamics calculations based on these potential energy surfaces produce accurate results, which are in good agreement with experiments. We have also proposed a new method for developing permutationally invariant potential energy surfaces, named fundamental-invariant neural networks. Mathematically, fundamental invariants are used to finitely generate the permutation-invariant polynomial ring; thus, fundamental-invariant neural networks can approximate any function to arbitrary accuracy. The use of fundamental invariants minimizes the size of the input permutation-invariant polynomials, which reduces the evaluation time for potential energy calculations, especially for polyatomic systems. Potential energy surfaces for OH3 and CH4 were constructed using fundamental-invariant neural networks, with their accuracies confirmed by full-dimensional quantum dynamics and bound-state calculations. These developments in the construction of highly accurate potential energy surfaces are expected to extend the theoretical study of reaction dynamics to larger and more complex systems. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.","Ab initio; Fundamental invariants; Neural networks; Potential energy surface; Reaction dynamics",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050186955

Nitrogen was injected quantitatively into an ammonia-stainless steel LHP to simulate NCG, and the steady state characteristics of the LHP were studied under three typical evaporator tilts. According to the experimental results, the main conclusions below can be drawn. (1) The temperature is the highest under adverse tilt and the lowest under favorable tilt no matter whether there is NCG in LHP. (2) The existence of NCG could cause the increase of temperature under all three typical evaporator tilts, but the temperature increment caused by NCG seems to be relatively small under adverse tilt. (3) The increments of the temperature caused by NCG display different patterns under different tilts. Theoretical analysis was conducted to explain the results: the temperature under the coupling effect of NCG and evaporator tilt was determined by the energy balance between the heat leak from evaporator to compensation chamber and the cooling capacity of returning subcooled liquid. With the increase of heat load, the augmentation of heat leak caused by NCG and the enhancement of subcooled liquid cooling effect were incongruent.

Merbarone was reported to inhibit DNA cleavage by hTopoIIα.

In this work, a systematic pharmacoinformatics analysis has been reported to analyze the merbarone-hTopoIIα interactions and to identify merbarone analogs as potential hTopoIIα inhibitors. The reported crystal structure of hTopoIIα-DNA complex (PDB ID: 4FM9) is not suitable for analyzing the merbarone-binding domain, because it is a biological assembly of hTopoIIα in C-gate open conformation. Therefore, 3D structure of hTopoIIα-DNA complex suitable for molecular modeling analysis at merbarone binding site was first generated. Using this generated complex, molecular docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the effect of merbarone on hTopoIIα-DNA complex. The binding energy for the enol form of merbarone with hTopoIIα-DNA was estimated to be −51.28 kcal/mol. The explored binding site and identified molecular recognition interactions were in accordance with the previously reported interference in the DNA-cleavage by merbarone. Virtual screening was performed using drug likeness filters, toxicity filters and ADMET descriptor based filters followed by molecular docking (ZINC database).

System-wide dynamic simulation provides a virtual test bench and analysis tool for assisting in process and control design and operational issues. Proper characterization of the thermal fluids in simulation tools is critical for successful simulation studies.

We present modelling of an indirect MS TES system connected to a thermal oil loop through TEMA type heat exchangers, model calibration with half of the experimental data, and finally, validation simulations against rest of the data. All these experimental data are previously unpublished. The model predicts the system behaviour with good agreement regarding temperatures, pressures, flow rates and liquid levels. The simulations suggest that the heat exchangers’ shell sides suffer from trapped non-condensable gas which significantly affects heat transfer, heat loss to ambient air and hydrodynamic losses. Our results contribute to thermal-hydraulic, system-wide modelling and simulation of MS processes.

However, transformerless converter topologies naturally present lower cost and size when compared with conventional solutions. As counterpart, transformerless systems need a boost conversion stage to compensate the absence of the step-up transformer. The two-stage converter (dc-dc boost converter plus voltage source inverter) has the step-up stage necessary to connect the low voltage source to the load, at a cost of more complexity and high leakage currents circulating in the system. The complexity issue can be overcome by using one-stage step-up plus inversion configuration such as the Z-source inverter, although the leakage current problem will persist. In order to solve both issues, this paper proposes a three-state three-phase Z-source inverter (TS3ph-ZSI) that presents an intrinsic buck-boost plus inverter characteristic, featuring a common ground between source and load (dual ground configuration), responsible to eliminate the leakage currents in the system. This topology is especially useful for transformerless photovoltaic systems. The theoretical analysis of this topology, including its modeling and control system design, is carried out and validated by the simulation and experimental results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Control design; DC-AC power converters; Energy conversion; Inverters; Three-phase electric power; Voltage control",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050553744

In this study, the differences in energy distributions between the LSCS and the double swirl combustion system (DSCS) were analyzed under different working conditions using a single-cylinder test system. A simulation calculation was used to compare the velocity, mixture equivalence ratio and in-cylinder temperature distributions of the working medium in the two combustion chambers, elucidating the different energy distributions of the two chambers. Additionally, a new idea is proposed herein for the design of LHR engines. The experimental results show that, compared with the DSCS under different operating speeds (1300–2100 r/min) and different loads (21–43 kW), the indicated thermal efficiency of the LSCS was approximately 2% higher, the percentage of the exhaust energy and heat transfer to the total energy was approximately 2% lower, the cylinder head temperature was 2–20.5 K lower, the ratio of the cylinder head heat transfer to the total heat transfer was 2–8% smaller and the heat transferred to the cooling water in the water jacket of the cylinder head was 0.2–1 kW lower. The in-cylinder velocity distribution, mixture equivalence ratio and temperature distribution of both the LSCS and the DSCS were compared through simulation. The results show that the fuel in the LSCS developed along the wall of the combustion chamber circumferentially due to the convex edge, and the high temperature zone distributed along the circumference of the combustion chamber. In the DSCS, most of the fuel moved to the cylinder head due to the circular ridge, and the high temperature zone existed near the cylinder head. The LSCS had a lower cylinder head temperature, a higher exhaust gas temperature, and less heat transferred to the cooling water through the cylinder head. Therefore, the unique shape of the LSCS chamber guided the movement of the fuel and reduced the concentration of the fuel/air mixture near the cylinder head, which reduced the heat transferred to the cooling system through the cylinder head and improved the thermal efficiency.

This novel design is a modular device, is bidirectional and is easily integrated and customised for different applications. The energy balance concept is achieved by employing a negative stiffness system to couple with a positive stiffness system of the mechanical system to create a zero stiffness system which can be driven with lower energy requirements. The bidirectional torsional negative stiffness mechanism proposed here uses a series of pre-compressed springs around a bidirectional torque shaft to convert decreasing force in the springs into increasing torque output through geometric reconfiguration to generate the negative stiffness characteristic. The kinematics of the negative stiffness mechanism were derived and a physical model was assembled from LEGO® components for validation. An analytical model was developed for prediction and the numerical results showed that a satisfactory performance can be generated to match the torque requirements. An experimental demonstrator was then built and tested to verify the predictions from the analysis. To show the impact of the energy balancing concept on actuator efficiency, a representative case study is made of a tendon-driven morphing active camber mechanism.

Jaya algorithm is used in this paper as the implementation of SVR is greatly reliant on the collection of its constraints. The predicting model is technologically advanced by means of weighted SVR configurations (ν -SVR and ϵ -SVR). Besides, the Jaya algorithm is deployed to decide the weights resultant to every configuration. An instance of time sequential power consumption information from a residential edifice in Denmark is employed to explicate the execution of the presented configuration. Furthermore, the anticipated model is able to estimate power consumption for half hour and daily time successions data for the similar building. The consequences depict that the proposed model demonstrates developed weight for ν -SVR for half hour data. Nevertheless, a sophisticated weight for ϵ -SVR is perceived for diurnal data. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for everyday power expenditure data is 5.521 while for half-hour power utilization is 3.769 correspondingly.

One of the potential fields for energy pile application is electric power industries. Implementing the energy piles in electric power industries can be majorly corresponded to two major subgroups, namely “direct applications” in power production facilities and power transmission-distribution networks and “indirect applications” in industrial target consumers. In both categories, some machineries or components need to be cooled or heated to assure proper operation. For heat exchange purposes, commonly a thermal fluid (e.g., water) circulation system is implemented which can be incorporated in energy pile foundations. Among the most important factors, which should be considered to select the energy pile system for heat exchange purposes in industrial machineries, are the magnitude of the flow rate and initial or final temperatures of the geothermal fluids and those corresponded to the operational capacity of the energy pile systems. In this paper, the possibility of direct or indirect usage of energy piles in electric power industries is studied. In this regard, technical aspects of the issue have been considered, analyzed and discussed. Results revealed that there are many principle or auxiliary devices in electric production and transmission-distribution networks or electric consuming industries, which an utilize the energy piles for heat exchange purposes.

Furthermore, the process is sensitive to varying degrees of human input, of differing complexity, at multiple levels. When it comes to validating ABMs, the virtual cornucopia of techniques can easily confuse the modeler. As useful as historical data validation is, it seems to be underutilized, most likely due to the fact that it is hard to find data suitable data for many models. For the purpose of In-Site, historical data availability is excellent due to Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) providing us with citizen and community based organization (CBO) preferences, and regulatory decisions being public. For the model, citizen and CBO preferences were decided by coding comments on the EIA procedure so as to allow for quantitative analysis, and then geocoding the locations of the commenters. The end results of this is that, we can literally overlay our simulation results with the actual, real world, results of the historical project.

The investigations revealed that when the stress triaxiality was similar, the notched and unnotched specimens had a similar fracture (damage) mechanism. Thus, the damage in tensile tests was correlated with Mode I fractures, while the damage in uniaxial compression and spherical indentation tests were correlated with Mode II fractures. Taking the damage mechanism into consideration, a unified energy release rate based model to calculate the fracture toughness was proposed. Compared with previous studies, the energy release rate based model proposed in this study has a clear physical meaning and can be applied to different specimen configurations.

Power consumption of the computing platform can be structured by dividing it into two parts: static and dynamic, where last of them is defined by processor load. There are two main approaches in solving the problem of reducing the computers’ power consumption at the hardware and at the operating system levels: the dynamic change of the processor voltage and frequency;the advanced configuration’s interface and power management technology. Only a few publications that take into account the user’s model when power saving PC’s control are known. Mostly, the terms «user’s model», «user’s behavior model» are used in works on ergonomics of the user’s interface, in search and advisory systems, in systems of user’s authentication, and also in tasks of identifying abnormal behavior of computing systems. Proposed solutions use models based on the measurement of the user’s motor activity with typical and most used devices for entering information: a keyboard and a manual manipulator «mouse». Also the existing models ignore the semantic and target components of the user’s behavior for which the elementary motor activity is carried out. Such components are manifested at the level of the operating system in the form of application’s starts/stops, switching of focus, etc., and they are also an integral part of the general model of user’s activity of the PC. The purpose of the article is to develop a model of user’s activity and the method of its identification in the system of PC’s power consumption. In addition the evaluation of the implementation of this model and methods in the system of the PC’s power consumption is of interest. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Adaptivity; BAUM-Welch method; Energy savings; Hidden Markov model; The dynamic change of the condition",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054180222

Hence, fast yet precise implementations are of high importance to research.

While the consideration of energy costs in scheduling has increased considerably in recent years, subcontracting is rarely analysed in scheduling literature. A mathematical MILP formulation is given to define the exact problem and to calculate optimal solutions for small instances. The objective is to minimise the total production costs for internal and external manufacturing including transportation and energy costs. Since, already the general HFSSP is NP-hard the considered problem is difficult to solve to optimality. Therefore, a genetic algorithm (GA) based on a detailed matrix encoding procedure is proposed. To the best of my knowledge this is the first time that a heuristic approach is presented for the considered problem. An algorithm for intelligent swaps to make use of waiting time and a right-shifting procedure to take advantage of time depending energy costs prove to be suitable to improve the performance of the GA significantly.

Through semi-structured interviews we identify certain procedural techniques that allowed process leaders to first build public trust in themselves, then in the process, and ultimately in the outcome. This chain of trust was fostered through informal efforts of process leaders to meet stakeholder expectations concerning process leaders’ ability to work for the public interest, provide meaningful engagement opportunities, and to produce non-discriminatory outcomes.

Ultrasonic waves caused the fast formation of supramolecular solvent aggregates.

However, in the immediate wake of the turbine, bed stress is dominated by the presence of the turbine itself, accounting for a ∼50% increase, with waves having a seemingly negligible effect up to 9D (D is the turbine diameter) downstream of the turbine. Beyond this point, the effect of waves on bed shear stress become apparent again. The influence of OBSTACLE on bed stress is also noticeable in the far wake, showing a reduction of ∼2% in wave height. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom shear stress; Oceanographic model; Tidal stream energy; Wave-current coupling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049533968

The adsorption energy, the electron charge and the magnetic moment were calculated through first principles methods. The investigation results show that on the fully H-Ter-D (0 0 1) surface, all surface C atoms have saturated bonds. However, the N atom can abstract the H atom from a surface carbon atom nearby or lead to the bond breaking of the dimer carbon atoms to form bonds with the surface carbon atoms. The maximum energy of adsorption reaches to 3.47 eV, corresponding to a stable configuration structure. The charge analysis and the density of state analysis further reveal that the N atom adsorbed has unpaired electrons, which provides the opportunity for adsorption of CH radicals. On the H-Ter-D (0 0 1) surface with one open radical site (1ORS) slab, the N atom can abstract the H atom from a surface carbon atom nearby and bond with the dimer carbon atoms. The adsorption energy rises to 4.85 eV. On the H-Ter-D (0 0 1) surface with the 2ORS slab, the activation energy for a N atom to migrate along the dimer chain to the next dimer is 1.31 eV. Moreover, the adsorption of the N atom on the 1ORS surface promotes the adsorption of a C atom nearby and improves the ability of C atom migration, which is beneficial for the growth of the diamond grains. According to the charge transform analysis, the electronegativity of N atoms plays an important role in their adsorption behaviors. In addition, when the N atom has been adsorbed on the H-Ter-D (0 0 1) surface, it could still be abstracted by the other deposited N atoms; this phenomenon may be the reason for a low deposition efficiency of N atoms in the N-doped diamond films. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Activation energy; Adsorption and migration behavior; First principles methods; N atom abstraction; N-doped diamond films",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052877276

The hydrodynamics are further complicated because the circular orbit of the blades changes their effective curvature. In order to address these technical challenges with modeling cross-flow turbines, this article presents a novel dynamic stall model with flow curvature correction. The dynamic stall model extends Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall theory, including several effects such as proper asymptotic behavior at large (∼90°) angles of attack, influence of reduced-pitch rate on the stall angle, dynamics of the flow separation point, and changes in effective camber due to flow curvature. Further, the model enables rapid hydrodynamic analysis of cross-flow turbines using free vortex methods. Important design parameters such as blade thickness and camber are explicitly accounted for in the model, which enables parametric study of turbine configurations and therefore makes the model useful for system-level turbine optimization. Numerical predictions are validated by experimental data for several cases, including ranges of blade profile, toe angle, solidity, and tip speed ratio. © 2018","Cross flow turbine; Dynamic stall; Free-wake vortex method; Model tidal turbine test; Tidal energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053121916

This study proposes an optimization on the fresh outdoor air ratio of stratum ventilation for both the targeted indoor air quality and maximal energy saving. A model of CO2 concentration in the breathing zone is developed by coupling CO2 removal efficiency in the breathing zone and mass conservation laws. With the developed model, the ventilation parameters corresponding to different fresh outdoor air ratios are quantified to achieve the targeted indoor air quality (i.e., targeted CO2 concentration in the breathing zone). Using the fresh outdoor air ratios and corresponding ventilation parameters as inputs, energy performance evaluations of the air conditioning system are conducted by building energy simulations. The fresh outdoor air ratio with the minimal energy consumption is determined as the optimal one. Experiments show that the mean absolute error of the developed model of CO2 concentration in the breathing zone is 1.9%. The effectiveness of the proposed optimization is demonstrated using TRNSYS that the energy consumption of the air conditioning system with stratum ventilation is reduced by 6.4% while achieving the targeted indoor air quality.

This need is especially critical in the hyper-arid region around the Arabian Gulf where per-person carbon emissions are among the highest in the world. Using geometrically sensitive simulation models for a household's building energy, water, and automobile use, this paper uses Emirati neighborhoods in Abu Dhabi, UAE as a case study to estimate emissions for a baseline and set of future possible scenarios towards transitioning single-family households in the region to low, and eventually near-zero operational carbon emissions. An analysis of the combined impact of energy efficiency gains through (1) technology adoption and better design, (2) carbon intensity reduction from renewable energy transitions, and (3) carbon sequestration from parcel scale tree planting is presented. From a baseline CO2 emissions of 64.3 tons per household per year for new construction, the study finds future emissions potential reductions of 33.7%–49.0% from improved house design, 98.1% from electrification and solar energy sourcing, and 99.4% from combined design and technology improvements. This study also finds that if the water-energy nexus in Abu Dhabi transitioned to solar-powered, reverse-osmosis desalination, trees would become net carbon sinks (0.6–1.9 kg CO2/m2/yr). As a result, in the future, low-density neighborhoods with dense areas of tree planting may become a sustainable housing typology when measured by net operational emissions. This fact would upend multiple current assumptions by Western planners about sustainable transitions for arid regions. © 2018 The Authors","Afforestation; Arid region; Energy modelling; Household metabolism; Low-carbon transition; Single-family housing",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054653428

In most published research, only the heave motion of the buoy is considered in the motion equation for the analysis. This is because the heave motion of the buoy strongly couples to the power take-off device (PTO), whereas the surge and pitch motions barely couple to the PTO. As a result, only the power arising from heave motion of the buoy can be efficiently absorbed when a single-tether PTO is used, leading to deficiency of the design in absorbing the power arising from its surge and pitch motion. In this paper, the deficiencies of single-tether PAs are addressed by simply shifting the center of gravity of the buoy away from its geometric centre. A spherical buoy with asymmetric mass is used in this paper for its simplicity. The asymmetric mass distribution of the buoy causes motion coupling across surge, heave and pitch motions, which enables strong coupling between the buoy's surge motion and the PTO movement. The operation principle and power generation of the spherical point absorber with asymmetric mass distribution (SPAMD) are investigated via a modal analysis conducted on a validated frequency-domain model. The results show that the SPAMD can be up to 3 times more efficient than the generic PAs when subjected to regular waves in the frequency range from 0.34 rad/sec to 1.4 rad/sec. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid frequency-domain model; Modal analysis; Spherical point absorber with asymmetric mass; Wave energy converter (WEC)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048788101

It covers an area of 3 m2, out of which 0.5 m2 is the target area or experimental plot and the simulated raindrops fall from a height of 2.3 m. Four types of full-jet spray nozzles are used to simulate rainfall intensities of 65, 93, 112, and 148 mm/h. The experimental plot can attain a maximum slope angle of 40° using a hydraulic jack unit. A temperature simulator is designed to replicate the natural conditions in the laboratory. Physical and numerical simulations are carried out to measure the characteristics of simulated rainfall and compare with those of natural rainfall conditions. The Christiansen coefficient (Cu) of the designed rainfall simulator varies from 81% to 88%. The rain droplet size ranges from roughly 1 mm to 5 mm and their corresponding terminal velocities range from 4.76 m/s to 10.64 m/s, striking velocities are found between 5.56 m/s and 9.63 m/s, and kinetic energies ranging from 0.0081 mJ to 3.0342 mJ.

Furthermore, statistical analysis of the experimental data is carried out by using signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio and the optimum condition for maximum soil erosion is predicted.

Since no long-range order is found following alanine adsorption on Pd(111), the adsorbate structure is determined from the substrate diffraction spots.

The influence of the key design variables on the performance of an air-based PCM TES system was first experimentally investigated using Taguchi method, and the results were used to develop two performance models for optimisation. A genetic algorithm was used to search for an optimal Pareto front and a multi-criteria decision-making process was employed to determine the compromise optimal solutions.

The elastohydrodynamic (EHD) regime more frequently occurs in nonconforming lubricated contacts with local elastic deformation due to high pressure in small contact area. The objective of this work is to analyze the EHD force reduced model applied to line contact based on restitutive and dissipative terms. In restitutive force term, an EHD stiffness approach is evaluated considering an explicit force-displacement relation with two independent parameters - stiffness and a constant surface separation force. Steady-state EHD contact numerical results allow estimating the restitutive parameters. The dissipative force term is composed by linear viscous damping. The damping is characterized by numerical simulation using the principle of energy conservation in transient elastohydrodynamic lubricated system. The influence of load and speed variations in damping fluctuations are investigated. The EHD reduced force model characterizes the lubricated contact in just three parameters (oil film stiffness, EHD constant surface separation force and viscous damping), simplifying the lubrication problem in comparison of solving EHD system of equations at each work condition and time step. This model can be applied to any nonconforming EHD line contact as cams, gears, needle element rolling bearings and cylindrical roller bearings in dynamic analysis and project stage development. Furthermore, an accurate contact model increases machine reliability, being promising to be used in model-based fault identification. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","EHD damping; EHD stiffness; Elastohydrodynamic lubrication; Line contact; Principle of energy conservation",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052212556

The vast majority of existing literature on robotics area coverage does not report the identification of ROIs. In a radiation field, ROIs limit the range of exploration to mitigate the monitoring problem. However, considering the limited resources of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as a mobile measurement system, it is challenging to determine ROIs in unknown radiation fields. Given the target area, we attempt to plan a path that facilitates the localization of ROIs with a single UAV, while minimizing the exploration cost. To reduce the complexity of exploration of large scale environment, initially whole areas are adaptively decomposed by the hierarchical method based on Voronoi based subdivision. Once an informative decomposed sub area is selected by maximizing a utility function, the robot heuristically reaches to contaminated areas and then a boundary estimation algorithm is adopted to estimate the environmental boundaries. Finally, the detailed boundaries are approximated by ellipses, called the ROIs of the target area and whole procedures are iterated to sequentially cover the all areas. The simulation results demonstrate that our framework allows a single UAV to efficiently and explore a given target area to maximize the localization rate of ROIs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Energy-efficient path planning; Environmental monitoring; Regions of interest coverage; UAV",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048232688

To present an appropriate assessment of the proposed control technique, under dynamic operating condition, a P–Q curve is extracted and analysed based on the different components and characteristics of the interfaced converter as well as the conventional relationship between the active and reactive power. By combining the swing equation of SG and the power-based dynamic model, a Pm–Q curve is achieved and the effects of the variations of embedded virtual inertia on virtual mechanical power are assessed. Moreover, by using small-signal linearization, the grid frequency stability is investigated based on both virtual inertia and mechanical power variations. In order to assess the power sharing ability of the proposed control technique, two transfer functions are obtained and then, the impacts of variations of virtual mechanical power on the active and reactive power of interfaced converter are evaluated through Nyquist and Root Locus diagrams. Simulation results confirm that the proposed control technique can guarantee the operation of interfaced converters, based on inherent characteristics of SG, to deal with the power grid stability with high penetration of RERs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Power grid stability; Renewable energy resources; Synchronous generator; Virtual inertia; Virtual mechanical power error",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054095967

Specifically, the vibrations of the unit in the X, Y and Z directions of the top cover, the upper and the lower brackets were all measured for three water heads (from 48% to 90% in terms of non-dimensional values) and nine load conditions (from 34% to 96% of the rated power) together with the pressure measurement at several typical monitoring points. Based on our analysis, it was found that the vibrations of the top cover are mainly induced by the fluid flow inside the reversible pump turbine while the vibrations of the upper and the lower brackets are generated by the mechanical aspects of the rotor. For the top cover, three regions are proposed with their characteristics and its physical origins fully demonstrated with the aid of several typical examples. In region I (with the low partial loads), the vibrational level of the unit is the highest and its physical origin is the pressure fluctuation in the vaneless space with the blade passing frequency. In region II (with the medium loads), the vibrational level of the unit is medium and its physical origin is the swirling vortex in the draft tube. In region III (with the high partial load), the vibrational level of the unit is the lowest and its physical origin is twofold: the pressure fluctuation in the vaneless space with the harmonics of blade passing frequency and the mechanical aspects of the rotor. For different water heads, transitions between aforementioned categorized regions could be observed with the primary characteristics maintained. At last, comparing with the cases of the top cover, the vibrations of the upper and the lower brackets are less affected by the load and the water head variations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Characteristic frequency; Pressure fluctuation; Pumped hydro energy storage; Reversible pump turbine; Vibration; Water head",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049877085

The woven basalt fabric was chosen as the composite reinforcement in FMLs due to its excellent mechanical and eco-friendly properties. Five different core layer arrangements were considered for sandwich panels in the experiments by arranging honeycomb core layers with different cell geometric dimensions. The deformation/failure modes of sandwich panels were obtained in the experiments, in terms of FML face-sheets and gradient honeycomb cores. The energy absorption of gradient honeycomb cores was quantitatively analyzed by digitizing the deformation/failure region of cores. The results showed that the use of basalt FMLs as face sheets can greatly enhance the blast resistance of sandwich panels compared with that with aluminum sheets as skins. The blast resistance of gradient sandwich panels not only depends on the geometric dimensions and arrangements of core layers, but also related to the intensity of target load which will cause different deformation/failure mechanism of panels. Thus, in order to obtain the best blast resistance, a well-design gradient sandwich panel should have suitable core layer arrangements and geometry to satisfy the intensity of target blast load. The results obtained from current study can give valuable reference to the using of sandwich panels in engineering protection field. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Basalt fiber metal laminates; Blast loading; Deformation/failure mode; Energy absorption; Gradient honeycomb sandwich panels",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054844148

Yet, their real-world energy efficiency strongly depends on driver behaviour and, often, showing optimal eco-driving behaviour is challenging especially if energy dynamics are not sufficiently represented in the driver interface. For example, previous research indicated that HEV drivers try to actively utilize and regain electric energy, without sufficiently considering conversion losses that are part of this process (i.e., energy conversion fallacy). One possible explanation is that HEV drivers do not actively consider kinetic energy while driving, mainly because it is not represented in energy displays. The object of the present research was to examine whether drivers can be supported in a less biased perception of the efficiency of regenerative braking when an indicator of kinetic energy is also represented in the interface. To this end, we designed an online video experiment. Two displays were presented to drivers, a conventional energy flow display in which only electric energy resources were represented and an adapted display in which also kinetic energy resources were represented. Drivers rated the perceived energy efficiency of two types of deceleration scenarios, regenerative braking and neutral mode. The results provide first evidence that adding a representation of kinetic energy resources to displays of energy flows in HEVs can reduce drivers’ energy conversion fallacy. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Driver behaviour; Framing effect; Neutral mode; Regenerative braking; User-Energy interaction",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052085395

It was previously shown for the model case of the plane motion of an RASSM equipped with an one degree of freedom manipulator with a load in the gripper that in the absence of the forces and moments external to the “base-manipulator-load” system in the study of a controlled relative motion, it is appropriate to introduce a given system into consideration. For the initial system’s nonzero kinetic moment determined by the initial conditions and remaining constant due to the momentum conservation principle, the given system is a nonlinear oscillatory system qualitatively similar to a mathematical pendulum. In this case, the kinetic energy of the initial system can be interpreted as the total energy of the given system, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential components. In absence of a control moment in the hinge, there is an energy integral of the equation for the given system, i.e., the equation of a phase trajectory family. The problems of the synthesis of program motions for an RASSM-associated nonlinear oscillating given system have been investigated. In particular, the pulse control option, which provides a transition to the required point of a phase plane by transferring the image point to the corresponding phase trajectory over a negligible time range, has been studied. Practical significance: the results obtained are of interest from the viewpoint of implementing the important principle of organizing the movement of robots—coordination of free and forced manipulator movements—in the synthesis of control for a robotic space module as an element of an assembly and servicing system for emerging orbital facilities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Optimum control in terms of energy consumption; Robotic assembly and servicing space modules; The given system",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053469903

In some cases, fractures may enhance permeability, but thermal energy storage at these shallow depths still remains challenging because of the complexity of fractured media to efficiently manage water circulation. To assess the feasibility of efficient thermal energy storage in shallow fractured crystalline bedrocks and to determine the fracture network geometric parameters that control heat storage in fractured media, we investigate abilities of a synthetic model especially dedicated to an innovative semi open-loop heat exchanger. The representative heat exchanger system consists of a network of star-shaped grooves radially arranged around a central borehole hydraulically and thermally insulated from the grooves. Fluid is injected in the downward direction into the grooves and withdrawn upward in the central insulated pipe. Heat is exchanged with the rock only through the grooves. The three geometrical parameters controlling the thermal storage are the width, the height and the number of grooves. With a dimensional analysis on heat transport equations and a sensitivity analysis on geometric parameters, we show that the conduction of temperature in rocks presents two well-separated short-term and long-term regimes. At short-term, maximum of exchanges is reached at the beginning of the heated water injection into the grooves. It is controlled by the thermal exchange surface depending on the number and width of the grooves. During the long-term regime, the heat exchanger capacity is mainly controlled by the accessible rock to thermal storage which depends mainly on the width of the grooves. We finally discuss about the possibility of extending the results obtained from the star-shaped geometric sensitivity study to natural fracture systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Crystalline rock; Fractured; Geothermal energy; Ground heat exchanger; Heat transport; Modelling; Standing column well",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053786846

According to the similarities between energy-dependent mission planning and the dynamic traveling salesman problem (DTSP), the energy-dependent mission planning is converted into a DTSP through two mappings from observation angle and energy to city and distance. In addition, to eliminate the uncertainty of feasible attitude trajectories/energy for a given scheduling strategy, a multiple-stage optimal energy factor is developed for the model extension. The paper further uses the time-optimal minΔTtransi-1,i in the transition time constraint as an input of the model to enlarge the optional execution time for the subsequent target in a consecutive observation. To solve this problem, a hybrid method integrating the Gauss pseudospectral method and the genetic algorithm (GPM-GA) is proposed which uses the genetic algorithm to generate the feasible solutions for scheduling process, whereas the Gauss pseudospectral method (GPM) is used to optimize the energy and the transition time constraint parameter for each solution. Extensive simulation results show that, compared with the classical genetic algorithm (CGA), the energy consumption and simulation time of the proposed algorithm are decreased effectively.

The maximum mass percentage of Na2SO4·10H2O-Na2CO3·10H2O eutectic within the composite is determined as 60%. The chemical composition of EV is measured by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF). The specific surface area of EV and raw vermiculite (RV) is characterized by Brunauer-Aemmett-Teller (BET) method. The results from Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests reveal that eutectic salt hydrate fully filled in the multilayer structure of EV and had good compatibility among the components of the composites. The phase change temperature and the melting enthalpy of the composites are 23.98 °C and 110.3 J/g respectively, which are measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Good thermal and structural reliability are also demonstrated by thermal gravimetric analysis (TG) techniques and thermal cycling tests. Moreover, the low thermal conductivity with 0.192 W/ (m K) tested by the Hot Disk via transient plane source method certifies that the composite is very applicable for insulation. The composite PCM is then tested in a reduced-scale test chamber outfitted with four thin PCM panels as insulated wallboards. The indoor temperature variations of the PCM room is compared with another identical chamber without PCM layer for evaluating the thermal regulating performance. The results show that the composite has the function of maintaining the indoor temperature at a comfortable range for a longer period and distinctly influenced the time delay.

The proper use of PCM in a building can reduce the energy demand considerably, keeping the indoor temperature within the comfort range. One of the major issues associated with the use of PCM is the dependency of its performance on the climate conditions, such as the ambient temperature in which it is used. This study introduces an innovative double layer PCM system aim to improve thermal comfort conditions and minimize energy demand. In the scope of PCM performance improvement under different climates during hot and cold months, a constructive solution is the incorporation of two PCM types with different properties, such as melting temperature and enthalpy in room envelopes. The behavior of such a system under five different climatic regions with emphasis on dry and semi-arid climates as dominant climates of Iran was numerically investigated. The study of this new system is conducted by a room with one exterior and some interior boundary conditions in hot and cold months.

Consequently, several computational intelligence techniques (CITs) for the prediction of ROP have been explored in the literature. This study explores the predictive capabilities of four commonly used CITs in the prediction of ROP and experimentally compare their predictive performance. The CIT algorithm utilizes predictors which are easily accessible continuous drilling data that have physical but complex relationship with ROP based on hydro-mechanical specific energy ROP model. The four CITs compared are the artificial neural network (ANN), extreme learning machine, support vector Regression and least-square support vector regression (LS-SVR). Two experiments were carried out; the first experiment investigates the comparative performance of the CITs while the second investigates the effect of reduced number of predictors on the performance of the models. The results show that all the CITs perform within acceptable accuracy with testing root mean square error range (RMSE) of 18.27–28.84 and testing correlation coefficient (CC) range of 0.71–0.94. LS-SVR has the best predictive performance in terms of accuracy with RMSE of 18.27 and CC of 0.94 while ANN has the best testing execution time at 0.03 s. Also utilizing the specific energy concept in chosen drilling parameters to be included among the predictors shows improved performance with five drilling parameters showing an improvement of 3%–9% in RMSE for LS-SVR in the two well studied. The utilization of the specific energy concept in the selection of the predictors in this study has demonstrated that the easily accessible drilling parameters have immense value to provide acceptable performance in the development of ROP model with CITs. © 2018","Drilling efficiency; Extreme learning machine; Least square support vector regression; Neural network; ROP prediction; Specific energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053533040

High fidelity computational solution approaches are essential for the analysis of flow-driven energy harvesters in order to capture the main physical aspects of the coupled problem and to accurately predict the power output of a harvester. While there are some phenomenological and numerical models for flow-driven harvesters reported in the literature, a fully three-dimensional strongly coupled model has not yet been developed, especially in the context of flow-driven energy harvesting. The weighted residuals method is applied to establish a mixed integral equation describing the incompressible Newtonian flow, elastic substrate structure, piezoelectric patch, equipotential electrode and attached electric circuit that form the multiphysics fluid-structure interaction problem. A monolithic numerical solution method is derived that provides consistent and simultaneous solution to all physical fields as well as to fluid mesh deformation. The approximate solution is based on a mixed space-time finite element discretization with static condensation of the auxiliary fields. The discontinuous Galerkin method is utilized for integrating the monolithic model in time. The proposed solution scheme is illustrated in the example of a lid driven cavity with a flexible piezoelectric bottom wall, demonstrating quantification of the amount of electrical energy extractable from fluid flow by means of a piezoelectric harvester device. The results indicate that in order to make reliable predictions on the power output under varying operational states, the realization of strong multiphysics coupling is required for the mathematical model as well as the numerical solution scheme to capture the characteristics of flow-driven energy harvesters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy harvesting; Fluid-structure interaction; Monolithic coupling; Space-time finite element method",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047103146

The mean flow fields showed a well-defined wake evolution for all configurations. As expected, the wake centerlines are aligned with the wind direction, however when wakes are in intermediate interaction, wakes centerlines are skewed. This has been imputed to the wake center determination method, which is not appropriate to dissociate multiple wakes. For the lower degree of interactions, the mean wakes are aligned. However the standard deviation of the instantaneous wake centerlines shows the mutual influence that one wake has on the other. Obtained results showed an increase in the turbulence intensity within the wake, but an asymmetric distribution was observed. Listing the possible reasons, no plausible explanation has been found. The wake meandering had been quantified by the standard deviation of the instantaneous wake centerlines, showing that this phenomenon is amplified by the level of interactions.

To this end, a number of investigations have been carried out to convert the carbon dioxide molecules into value-added chemicals. As carbon dioxide is thermodynamically stable, it is necessary to develop an efficient carbon dioxide utilization method for future scaled-up applications. Recently, several approaches, such as electrocatalysis, thermolysis, and non-thermal plasma, have been utilized to achieve carbon dioxide conversion. Among them, nonthermal plasma, which contains chemically active species such as high-energy electrons, ions, atoms, and excited gas molecules, has the potential to achieve high energy efficiency without catalysts near room temperature. Here, we used radio-frequency (RF) discharge plasma, which exhibits the non-thermal feature, to explore the decomposition behavior of carbon dioxide in non-thermal plasma. We studied the ionization and decomposition behaviors of CO2 and CO2-H2 mixtures in plasma at low gas pressure. The non-thermal plasma was realized by our custom-made inductively coupled RF plasma research system. The reaction products were analyzed by on-line quadrupole mass spectrometry (differentially pumped), while the plasma status was monitored using an in situ real-time optical emission spectrometer. Plasma parameters (such as the electron temperature and ion density), which can be tuned by utilizing different discharge conditions, played significant roles in the carbon dioxide dissociation process in non-thermal plasma. In this study, the conversion ratio and energy efficiency of pure carbon dioxide plasma were investigated at different values of power supply and gas flow. Subsequently, the effect of H2 on CO2 decomposition was studied with varying H2 contents. Results showed that the carbon dioxide molecules were rapidly ionized and partially decomposed into CO and oxygen in the RF field. With increasing RF power, the conversion ratio of carbon dioxide increased, while the energy efficiency decreased. A maximum conversion ratio of 77.6% was achieved. It was found that the addition of hydrogen could substantially reduce the time required to attain the equilibrium of the carbon dioxide decomposition reaction. With increasing H2 content, the conversion ratio of CO2 decreased initially and then increased. The ionization state of H2 and the consumption of oxygen owing to CO2 decomposition were the main reasons for the V-shape plot of the CO2 conversion ratio. In summary, this study investigates the influence of power supply, feed gas flow, and added hydrogen gas content, on the carbon dioxide decomposition behavior in non-thermal RF discharge plasma. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.","Carbon dioxide; Decomposition ratio; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen; Radio frequency discharge plasma; Reaction equilibrium",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053136191

Co-segmentation can help preserve object boundaries, but it may suffer from complex scenes. To address these issues, we develop a unified method that addresses co-saliency detection and co-segmentation jointly via solving an energy minimization problem over a graph. Our method iteratively carries out the region-wise adaptive saliency map fusion and object segmentation to transfer useful information between the two complementary tasks. Through the optimization iterations, sharp saliency maps are gradually obtained to recover entire salient objects by referring to object segmentation, while these segmentations are progressively improved owing to the better saliency prior. We evaluate our method on four public benchmark data sets while comparing it to the state-of-the-art methods.

Monitoring their evolution allows for a better comprehension and control of the process, hence enhancing the deposition quality. In particular, the deposition height is an important variable that, if it does not match the process growth, can bring to defects and geometrical inaccuracies in the deposited structures. The current work presents a system based on optical triangulation for the height monitoring, implemented on a LMD setup composed of a fiber laser, a deposition head, and an anthropomorphic robot. Its coaxial and non-intrusive configuration allows for flexibility in the deposition strategy and direction. A measurement laser beam is launched through the powder nozzle and hits the melt pool. A coaxial camera acquires the probe spot, whose position is converted to relative height. The device has been demonstrated for monitoring the deposition of a stainless steel cylinder.

Here we explored three major questions in order to extend knowledge of the relationship between reproduction rate, diet and energy intake in White Storks Ciconia ciconia based both on our own analysis of pellets and landscape properties sampled in 52 nests in south-western Poland, and published literature data. (1) How many individual prey items are needed to meet the daily energy requirements of nestlings over the brood rearing period? (2) How do the dietary patterns vary under different habitat conditions and what is the spatial scale responsible for these relationships? (3) Is reproductive output related to variations in landscape traits, and is diet variability related to intraspecific competition resulting from colonial breeding? In our estimation, the energy requirements of nestlings during the brood rearing period showed that the most profitable invertebrate prey items were Orthoptera and earthworms. Owing to the nestlings’ gape-size constraint (precluding consumption of vertebrate prey items of the size of Common Voles), these most likely comprise the staple diet enabling survival during the first 20 days of life. The total energy content across all the pellets was a simple function (a negative correlation) of %arable land within a distance of 5 km around the nests. White Storks from nests of high-productivity pairs (with 3–4 fledglings and less %arable around) consumed equal %biomasses of invertebrate and vertebrate prey, while invertebrates prevailed in the diet of the low-productivity pairs. Our results suggest that a two-level ontogenetic trophic bottleneck may explain the low productivity of White Stork pairs in simplified landscapes with predominant arable land use. As a result of this, parent birds are unable to satisfy the growing energy demands of nestlings (1) by gathering a sufficient volume of abundant small-sized prey (early nestlings) and (2) by delivering energetically more profitable vertebrate prey at the time of the diet switch. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Energy requirements; Invertebrate prey; Microtus arvalis; Nestling diet; Ontogenetic diet switch; Orthoptera",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050524560

A numerical model to simulate nuclear structural behaviors in earthquake is validated by comparison with data from a previous study on a nonlinear dynamic analysis of a reinforced concrete shield building. The validated numerical model is then used to carry out a series of parametric analyses with 112 computational cases so as to determine influence of strong aftershocks on structural elastic-plastic behavior considering input of three-dimensional ground motions. The results indicate that the influence of aftershocks on structural horizontal/vertical dynamic responses is very small in design basis earthquake sequences. However, the influence must be considered seriously in beyond-design basis earthquake sequences as values of RMVs (Ratio of Mean Value) deviating IPRs (Input Peak Ratio) obviously, which means structural dynamic responses are greatly changed in strong aftershocks. Damage aggravating effect induced by strong aftershocks can cause severe damage of structural members and it is found the greater the magnitude of aftershocks, the severer the aggravation effect. Although earthquake input energy is mostly dissipated by damping energy, plastic damage energy plays considerable role in strong aftershocks as it shares beyond 8 percent of the total input energy, which is 10 times more compared to design basis earthquake sequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","AP1000 nuclear structure; Earthquake sequences; Elastic-plastic behavior; Energy distribution; Numerical simulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053420149

Since the problem involves assigning jobs to machines and selecting an appropriate processing speed level for each job, we characterize each individual by two vectors: a job-machine assignment vector and a speed vector. To accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, only the speed vector of each individual evolves and a list scheduling heuristic is applied to derive its job-machine assignment vector based on its speed vector. To further enhance the algorithm, we propose efficient speed adjusting and job-machine swap heuristics and integrate them into the algorithm as a local search approach by an adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy. Computational results reveal that the incorporation of list scheduling heuristic and local search greatly strengthens the algorithm.

In this paper, CO2 is selected as the working fluid and a model is proposed to simulate the CO2 flow in the retrofitted wellbores. The CO2 is injected into the inner tube (injector) and then flows out through the annuli (producer) to surface. The proper length of the insulation layer installed outside the casing is predicted. Results show that: (a) when the CO2 flows from well-bottom to well-head in the producer, its temperature has an increase at first and then turns to decrease. An insulation layer outside the casing is an efficiency way to prevent CO2 from transferring heat to the stratum.

This is especially important for cyber-physical systems where power consumption strongly influences the battery life. For this reason, software developers should be more aware of the energy consumed by their systems. Moreover, software systems should be developed to adapt their behavior to minimize the energy consumed during their execution. This can be done by monitoring the usage context of the system and having runtime support to react to those changes that impact the energy footprint negatively. Although both the hardware and the software parts of cyber-physical systems can be adapted to reduce its energy consumption, this paper focuses on software adaptation. Concretely, the paper illustrates how to address the problem of developing context-aware energy-efficient applications using a Green Eco-Assistant that makes use of advanced software engineering methods, such as Dynamic Software Product Lines and Separation of Concerns.

The present research has the objective of establishing how this parameter affects the shoreline evolution behind the array and, on this basis, to propose and apply a method to determine the optimum spacing for coastal protection. The method is demonstrated on a beach subjected to severe erosion. Five case studies are considered: four with different inter-WEC spacings, and one without the wave farm (baseline). A spectral wave propagation model is applied to analyse the variations in significant wave height behind the WEC array. Longshore sediment transport rates are calculated, and a shoreline model is applied. We find that in all the case studies the dry beach area is greater than in the baseline (no farm) case study, which proves the capacity of the dual WEC array to mitigate the erosive trends of the system. Importantly, we obtain that the inter-WEC spacing plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the shoreline and, consequently, in the effectiveness of the WEC array for coastal protection. The case studies with intermediate spacings yield the best performance in terms of dry beach area. More generally, the benefits of dual wave farms in terms of protection of coastal properties and infrastructure, and the ensuing savings in conventional coastal defence measures (coastal structures, beach nourishment, etc.) contribute to the development of wave energy by enhancing its economic viability. The methodology presented in this paper can be used to optimize the design of dual wave farms elsewhere. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Coastal defence; Erosion; Sediment transport; Shoreline evolution; Sustainable development; Wave energy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050671069

The mathematical model is described by the coupled system of equation for displacement, fracture and matrix pressures. For a fine grid approximation, we use the finite volume method for flow problem and finite element method for mechanics. Due to the complexity of fractures, solutions have a variety of scales, and fine grid approximation results in a large discrete system. Our second focus in the construction of the upscaled coarse grid poroelasticity model for fractured media. Our upscaled approach is based on the nonlocal multicontinuum (NLMC) upscaling for coupled flow and mechanics problem, which involves computations of local basis functions via an energy minimization principle. This concept allows a systematic upscaling for processes in the fractured porous media, and provides an effective coarse scale model whose degrees of freedoms have physical meaning. We obtain a fast and accurate solver for the poroelasticity problem on a coarse grid and, at the same time, derive a novel upscaled model.

However, the distribution uniformity of applied irrigation can modify the way reduced water applications influence field-averaged performance, especially for crops sensitive to water stress as maize, in which the most sensitive stages are those related with reproduction and grain formation. We evaluated the effect of irrigation uniformity on the yield and profitability of maize (Zea Mays L.) in Albacete, Spain in two adjacent sectors equipped with a solid set sprinkler irrigation system of a field managed according to FAO-56 methodology throughout the growing season to maximize grain yield without water stress (Sector S1) or irrigation scheduling determined by an experienced producer (Sector S2). Irrigation uniformity was evaluated using catch cans in both fields and grain yield was harvested within zones exhibiting 75% (Z1), 100% (Z2), and 125% (Z3) of area-averaged volume applications throughout the year. The average coefficient of uniformity (CU) in both sectors (S1 and S2) was 83.5%, and the net amount of applied irrigation water totaled 709 mm in S1 and 832 mm in S2. Average grain yield in sector S2 approached the maximum expected yield of 18.4 Mg ha−1 and exhibited no significant differences in yield among zones. In contrast, sector S1 exhibited significant yield differences (p &lt; 0.05) among zones with a measured yield in Z3 of 18.5 Mg ha−1 and a yield reduction of 1.6 Mg ha−1 and 4.0 Mg ha−1 in Z2 and Z1, respectively. Consequently, the area-averaged yield in S1 was 8% less than in S2. This last treatment was positively influenced by a higher amount of irrigation water supplied to the crop (17%), which decreased the effect of low CU (83.5%). The grain yields simulated by MOPECO for each monitoring zone within the sectors exhibited similar magnitude and trends. Because of these yield differences and the relatively low cost of irrigation water, area averaged gross margin in S1 was 18% less compared with S2. Simulations with MOPECO over a range of CU's demonstrated that improved irrigation uniformity increased area-averaged yields and gross margin when following S1 instead of S2 strategy. The main innovations of this work were to quantify the effect of irrigation uniformity on the gross margin of a maize crop, and to highlight that in arid and semiarid areas with water scarce conditions, it is a better strategy to improve the irrigation uniformity than supply a higher amount of irrigation water to mask the lack of uniformity. © 2018","Crop modeling; Energy saving; Irrigation scheduling; MOPECO; Solid set sprinkler irrigation system; Water saving",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054197418

Coupled multi-body dynamic model of the robot is developed based on free-body diagram approach. Optimal feet forces and corresponding joint torques on all the legs are determined based on the minimization of the sum of the squares of joint torques, using quadratic programming (QP) method. An energy consumption model is developed to determine the minimum energy required for optimal values of feet forces. To ensure dynamically stable gaits, dynamic gait stability margin (DGSM) is determined from the angular momentum of the system about the supporting edges. Computer simulations have been carried out to test the effectiveness of the developed dynamic model with crab wave gaits on a banking surface. It is observed that when the swing leg touches the ground, impact forces (sudden shoot outs) are generated and their effects are also observed on the joints of the legs.

The developed architecture integrates two different monitoring networks: the ‘Fixed Network’ and the ‘Custom Network.’ The ‘Fixed Network’ is an industrial control system able to collect data, control and monitor real-time consumptions through specific power modules plugged into an electrical cabinet. The ‘Custom Network’ is a system realized through low-cost commercial devices, located inside the building, to collect the continuous measurements for the internal comfort. Therefore, thanks to the use of those measuring instruments, it is possible to track both the energy consumptions and the internal comfort indicators that influence the assessment of the building model. Once data are collected, a software architecture has been designed for managing pseudo-real-time data flows, taking into account flexibility and speed of storage and retrieval.

The N-doping was shown to generate thermodynamically stable systems with different electronic properties, which can be further confirmed by ab initio Molecular Dynamics simulations. In this work, we also analyzed the chemical stability and reactivity with the following criteria: hardness, chemical potential, and electronic density. The GYN system with defects (GYN-def) presents the lowest-energy of formation and cohesion, indicating that it may correspond to the most energetically stable system. The catalytic character of the series of graphyne systems under study was tested by assessing the capability to adsorb the O2 molecule on the graphyne substrate.

These studies were carried out to gain information and insight into the role that a material's dynamic mechanical properties have on the overall IEA performance of sport (and military) apparel pad structures. Results show that the tan(δ) of FEAM materials increases as the measuring frequency and flocked layer's flock density increase. Tan(δ)’s behavior at various temperatures (0 °C–50 °C) did not follow an expected trend; the highest tan(δ) value was observed to occur at room temperature. Nevertheless, the obtained tan(δ) information on these various FEAM configurations should provide some guidance in designing optimized FEAM sport (and military) pad IEA composites. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy absorbing materials; Flocked fabrics; Loss tangent; Sport padding; Viscoelastic properties",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054193867

The knowledge about this characteristic is obviously trivial from an experimentalist's point of view. However, it is not considered in the vast majority of material models in which “only” deterministic behavior is taken into account. One very promising approach to the inclusion of stochastic effects in modeling of materials is provided by the so-called Chaos Polynomial Expansion. It has been used, for example, to derive the so-called stochastic finite element method. This method yields results that are exactly of the desired kind, but unfortunately at increased numerical costs. This contribution aims to propose a new ansatz that is also based on a stochastic series expansion along with an appropriate relaxation procedure at the Gauβ point level. Energy relaxation provides a synthesized (deterministic) stress measure, while simultaneously offering stochastic properties such as the variance. The total procedure only needs negligibly more computation effort than a simple elastic calculation. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Analytical solution; Energy relaxation; Stochastic material behavior; Stochastic series expansion; Stress expectation and variance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052916725

Due to lack of milk cooling facilities, dairy farmers in areas without access to reliable grid electricity face problems of high milk spoilage and limited access to formal markets, which limits their income and standard of living. This article examines the economic viability for a number of configurations of off-grid solar, wind, biomass and biogas based milk-cooling systems serving a community in Tanzania. Key risk factors having the greatest impact on system viability are identified and a stochastic approach, by means of a Monte Carlo simulation is employed to determine the risk-adjusted economic performance of the project. The results indicate that biogas based systems offer the most viable option, with an internal rate of return of around 25%, a net present value of around $9000 and a projected increase in farmers’ monthly income of at least 78%. Despite specific risk factors, the 300-L cooling system had an 82% probability of a positive net present value.

Experiments were carried out with five carbonaceous materials under different biomass feeding rates in the range of 0.8–2.7 g/min at 1300 °C in order to optimize the synthesis gas production and composition. Increasing biomass feeding rate (at constant slightly over-stoichiometric steam/biomass ratio) noticeably promoted the syngas yields that reached up to 83.2 mmol/gbiomass.

The calorific value of the biomass was solar upgraded up to 24% through the syngas produced with a carbon conversion above 90%, thereby accomplishing efficient solar energy storage into the produced syngas. Increasing the biomass feeding rate inherently shortened the solar processing duration (for a given biomass amount).

The proposed shell structures respect all symmetries of the face-centered cubic crystal. To obtain a smooth curvature shell structure, the exact shape of the shell mid-plane is determined through the minimization of a bending-energy based measure of the overall curvature. Among the members of this new family, the mechanical properties of a Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) -like architecture and an elastically-isotropic derivate are investigated in detail. The TPMS-like structure showed important anisotropy in both its small and large strain responses, with loading-direction dependent differences in stiffness of more than 100%. The mechanical properties of the elastically-isotropic shell-lattice turned out to be close to the mean value for all directions of loading for the TPMS-like structures. For relative densities ranging from 1% to 50%, the shell-lattices always exhibited a higher mechanical performance than truss-lattices of equal density. For relative densities greater than 20%, the mechanical response of the shell-lattices is more stable than that of truss-lattices which makes them particularly suitable as higher order structures in hierarchical metamaterial design. The computational results are partially confirmed through compression experiments on additively-manufactured stainless steel specimens. A direct comparison of the stress–strain curve of additively-manufactured stainless steel 316 L with that of sheets made from the same alloy revealed an increase in yield strength of about 30% related to the selective laser melting process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Architected materials; Energy absorption; Mechanical metamaterials; Shell-lattices; Stiffness; Unit cell analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052967851

Due to the traditional utilize of external shadings and lack of appropriate design standard for buildings in China low latitude region, this study proposes a workflow for optimizing WWR with sunshades by considering both daylighting performance and energy consumption. The reference WWR is firstly decided based on the requirements of daylighting standards by using Radiance for standard room without external shading, and the reference annual cooling load of the whole building is then calculated by EnergyPlus. A large number of cases with different WWRs and external shadings are calculated and energy-saving and daylighting performances are finally verified with reference case. The optimal WWR value range with different sunshades configurations in different orientations is that meets daylighting requirement while below reference annual cooling load. The results indicate that comprehensive sunshades have the best energy performance with the benefits of both horizontal and vertical ones. With a 1.8 m comprehensive sunshade, the lower threshold of WWR raises to 0.40 for meeting daylighting requirement, and the accepted upper threshold of WWR range for west, north, east and south-facing units could reach to 0.56, 0.6, 0.6 and 0.78 respectively. For designing a building with façade the same in all orientations, the largest WWR could be set as 0.7 for west-east buildings and 0.55 for south-north buildings with 1.8 m comprehensive sunshades. The scenario has been verified and this WWR optimization process could be applied to different buildings in other climate regions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Daylighting; Energy-saving; Optimization process; Sunshades; Window-to-wall ratio (WWR)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054860886

It is a crucial material property for describing nanoscale plasticity phenomena in crystalline materials, such as dislocation dissociation, nucleation, and twinning. The dependence of the GSFE on applied stress normal to the stacking fault has been suggested to influence such phenomena. Here, the stacking fault stress dependence is analyzed through (i) the generalized stacking fault potential energy (GSFE) and (ii) the generalized stacking fault enthalpy (GSFH). At an imposed shear displacement, there is also an associated inelastic inter-planar normal displacement around the fault. Extensive molecular statics simulations with interatomic potentials and/or first principle calculations in Ni, Cu, Al and Mg reveal that GSFE and inelastic normal displacement both increase with tensile stress. An increasing GSFE contradicts long-standing wisdom and previous studies. Positive inelastic normal displacement coupled to the applied normal stress decreases the GSFH, but is not useful for general mechanics problems. The existence of the inelastic displacement can lead to incorrect measurements of the GSFE and GSFH in finite systems loaded by an applied strain.

The literature shows more than 80 countries having wind installations and there is the expectation to have expanded investments to about U$ 3.6 trillion until 2040. High capacity wind generators are well developed and usually installed offshore where the wind velocity is relatively high and constant over most of the year. On the other hand, small windmills are usually installed for individual and community use in urban and isolated areas. These machines are usually supposed to generate energy at relatively low wind speeds, have simple construction and relatively low maintenance cost. This paper seeks to determine the aerodynamic performance and annual energy production for small horizontal axis windmill of 10 kW nominal power using airfoil of families NACA, Gottingen and Selig. The formulation of the aerodynamic model is based on the combined momentum and blade element theory. A numerical code is developed and validated against available numerical results showing good agreement. From the numerical predictions, it was found that for nominal speed of 10 m/s Gottingen airfoil produced the highest amount of energy. Further numerical investigation was realized to determine details of the rotor blades such as chord and twist angle distributions along the blade, variation of the axial and tangential induction factors and distributions of thrust and torque along the blade length. The results indicated that the Gottingen airfoil GO482 produced the highest values of coefficient of power and the biggest annual energy production in comparison with the investigated NACA and Selig airfoils. Because of this good performance it can be recommended for small windmills applications. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aerodynamic performance; Annual energy production; Blade element momentum theory; Gottingen 482 airfoil; Wind turbine",Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052229407

It is significant to research the relationship between high-frequency oscillation and epilepsy originating area for the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy. In view of the identification of epileptic EEG and the location of epileptic foci, a localization algorithm based on Teager operator is proposed. Firstly, the original epileptic EEG data are preprocessed, the wavelet weighted threshold and the frequency notch method are used to denoise the original epileptic high frequency oscillation signal. Taking into account the frequency characteristics of the high frequency oscillating signal itself, the FIR (Finite Impulse Response) digital filter is used to filter the epileptic high-frequency oscillation signal. Secondly, because the high frequency oscillation rhythm has the characteristics of high frequency, high energy and low amplitude, the Teager energy operator and curve length method are used to extract the characteristics. The PSD (Power Spectral Density) method is applied to qualitative analysis of epileptic lesion location. Finally, the EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) algorithm is used to decompose the high-frequency oscillation signal. Combined with Teager energy operator, Teager-huang transform is used to analyze the signal by time-frequency energy analysis. Quantitative analysis of epileptic lesion location is made by using EMD energy entropy method for different lead epileptic signals. The algorithm can effectively locate the location of the focus, independent of individual parameters and high degree of automation.

Indeed, the transition toward a sustainable energy regime is strongly influenced by governance and regulatory frameworks extending from a global to a local scale, which set boundaries and incentives for the direction in which energy transition can evolve. Since 2007, several local initiatives have emerged in the county of Marburg-Biedenkopf in Germany promoting the use of biomass on a local scale.

This article analyzes if and how people use party cues when determining their support for nuclear energy. We conducted a public opinion survey in Belgium in 2015, which is representative for the population on age, gender, education and level of urbanization. Our results indicate that parties have a net-effect on support for nuclear energy although the effect is modest compared to the effects of the psychometric variables. Furthermore, we show that partisan cue taking occurs more amongst voters of parties that have a clear and opposing position on nuclear energy (i.e. the issue owning parties and the policy defending parties). Cue taking voters of these parties became somewhat more extreme in their support for nuclear energy in the direction advocated by their preferred party. Hence, parties seem to have a polarizing impact on public opinion on nuclear energy. Furthermore, partisan cue taking on nuclear energy occurred more amongst respondents more knowledgeable/strongly involved on the issue of nuclear than amongst those less knowledgeable/less involved. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Elite influence; Nuclear energy; Party cue taking; Polarization; Political parties; Support",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054767476

A frequently used technological solution, which makes it possible to minimize the transmitted force, consists in adding damping devices to the rotor supports. To achieve their optimum performance in a wide range of operating speeds, their damping effect must be adaptable to the current angular velocity. This is offered by magnetorheological squeeze film dampers. Their main parts are two concentric rings separated by a layer of magnetorheological oil. Its squeezing produces the damping force. As magnetorheological fluids are sensitive to magnetic induction, the change of magnetic flux passing through the lubricating film changes the damping force. The goal of the carried out investigations was to study the influence of controllable damping in rotor supports on energy losses and driving moment of the motor in different velocity ranges. The investigations were performed by computational simulations. The rotor was rigid, supported by magnetorheological squeeze film dampers, and excited by its unbalance. The results show that appropriate adaptation of the magnitude of the damping force to the current operating speed arrives at minimizing the energy losses generated in the rotor supports.

In order to gain insight into the relevance of specific electrophysiological sleep characteristics for metabolic control, we assessed the acute effect on glucose homeostasis as well as energy intake and expenditure of enhancing slow oscillatory activity, a hallmark of slow-wave sleep, by closed-loop auditory stimulation in healthy men. Twenty-two young, normal-weight men underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT), indirect calorimetry and the assessment of ad-libitum breakfast intake in the morning after nocturnal sleep with or without auditory stimulation in phase with the ongoing rhythmic occurrence of slow oscillation up-states during 210 min of slow-wave sleep in the first night-half. Stimulation vs. no stimulation strongly increased slow oscillatory activity without changing overall sleep structure, but did not alter fasting or oGTT-stimulated measures of glucose homeostasis.

To gain further confidence for applications within design using the proposed analytical procedure, it is evident that more detailed and comprehensive comparisons and validations with experiments and numerical simulations are necessary. The purpose of the present paper is to use the analytical approach and finite element analyses to study in depth model-scale and full-scale collision tests so that to further quantify key calculation parameters and to verify the capability and accuracy of the proposed analytical method.

The 18 experimental energy absorption-penetration and collision force-penetration curves, and the associated finite element simulations, are compared with results obtained from the analytical calculations. It can be concluded that the analytical method gives consistently good agreement with all experiments analysed here.

As a result, renewable and green energy technologies have gained lot of attention in the recent years. In particular, the improvement of solar panel efficiency has grabbed a significant domain of researchers’ interest since sun is the year-round available source of energy that can be efficiently utilized for energy generation. However, a significant part of the incident solar energy is being lost due to the reflection at the air/glass interface as well as the accumulation of dusts on the modules. Hence, the surface morphology and characteristics of solar panel surfaces have recently been enhanced using multifunctional thin films or coatings in order to improve their self-cleaning, anti-reflection, anti-fogging and energy transmittance properties of the coated solar panels. A wide range of materials and methods have been employed in fabrication of solar panel coatings including superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic and photoactive coating surfaces. In this review, the current state of fabrication of solar panel coatings and their properties, including surface morphology, wettability, electrical conductivity and light transparency characteristics, are discussed. The review starts with discussing the fundamental concept of self-cleaning (i.e., superhydrophobicity/superhydrophilicity) and antireflective (i.e., transparency) properties followed by presenting a review of the recent methods and technologies used in manufacturing of superhydrophobic, superhydrophilic, photoactive and transparent thin films used in solar panel coatings. More importantly, the recent development on the fabrication and application of self-cleaning and dust-repellent antireflective coatings in solar modules have been discussed.

Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments.

The control is based on the decoupling of the active and reactive currents. It permits to indirectly control active and reactive powers injected into the grid. The control strategy is based on the decoupling of the inverter output currents to active and reactive currents using the Park transformation. The decoupled currents (active and reactive) are compared with the reference values. The reference active current is calculated from the DC regulator output, the reactive current reference is set to zero to ensure a unit power factor. To reduce the voltage variations of the DC bus, we add a PI regulator with anti-windup compensation. Due to non-linear I-V characteristics of PVs generators and environmental conditions, the PVs generators give maximum power only at a single point. A DC/DC converter controlled by MPPT is introduced at the output of the PVs generators to track the maximum power point (MPP).

Solvent effect, reaction time, reaction temperature and fructose-to-catalysts mass ratio have been investigated. The SBA-15-SO3H solid acid catalyst can be separated from the reaction mixture after reaction and reused by simple centrifugalization, and 100% fructose conversion with 95% HMF yield could be retained. Further, reaction activation energy of 56.4 kJ/mol has been fitted with kinetic analysis, which means that the dehydration of fructose into HMF is relative easier over SBA-15-SO3H catalyst in this work. Besides, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements reveal that the –SO3H grafting on the SBA-15 surface have no obvious influence on its mesoporous structure even after five catalytic cycles, and acid site measurements demonstrate that there was no significant loss of acid site concentration, indicating high catalytic stability.

Because long echo-time J-difference 1H-MRS detection of lactate is less susceptible to this shortcoming, we posited if J-edited fMRS protocol could reliably detect metabolic changes in the human motor cortex during a finger-tapping paradigm in relation to a reliable measure of basal lactate. Our J-edited fMRS protocol at 4T was guided by an fMRI pre-scan to determine the 1H-MRS voxel placement in the motor cortex.

These J-edited fMRS results demonstrate good sensitivity and specificity for task-induced lactate modulation, suggesting that J-edited fMRS studies can be used to investigate the metabolic underpinning of human cognition by measuring lactate dynamics associated with activation and deactivation fMRI paradigms across brain regions at magnetic field lower than 7T. © 2018","Aerobic glycolysis; Energy metabolism; Finger tapping; Functional MRS; Glutamate-glutamine cycling; Lactate; Motor cortex; Neuroimaging; Oxidative phosphorylation; β-hydroxybutyrate",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053323524

Secondly, we deduce the carbon intensities and contribution potentials of industrial and energy structure adjustments to achieving the carbon intensity target by 2020 under 27 combined scenarios.

Zirconia was deposited using a UHV-compatible sputter source, resulting in layer-by-layer growth and good uniformity of the films. For thicknesses of 2–4 ML, a layer-dependent influence of the substrate on the structure of the thin films is observed. Above this thickness, films show a (2 × 1) or a distorted (2 × 2) surface structure with respect to cubic ZrO2(111); these structures correspond to tetragonal and monoclinic zirconia, respectively. The tetragonal phase occurs for annealing temperatures of up to 730 °C; transformation to the thermodynamically stable monoclinic phase occurs after annealing at 850 °C or above. High-temperature annealing also breaks up the films and exposes the Rh(111) substrate. We argue that the tetragonal films are stabilized by the interface to the substrate and possibly oxygen deficiency, while the monoclinic films are only weakly defective and show band bending at defects and grain boundaries. This observation is in agreement with positive charge being responsible for the grain-boundary blocking effect in zirconia-based solid electrolytes.

Depending on its pore structure the carrier can furthermore prevent or inhibit leakage of the salt solution. It has been shown experimentally that by impregnation with CaCl2 the heat storage density of zeolite Ca-X can be increased by 53 % to 270 kWh m−3, which confirms the potential of this material class. In transforming this potential into technical heat storage solutions, numerical simulations can support the design process by bridging the gap between material characterization, process specification and reactor design. Such simulations rest, among others, on suitable constitutive relations. For the equilibria and kinetics of salt/zeolite composite sorbents those relations are still missing in the literature. In this work, we present an axisymmetric model of the mass and heat transport through a packed bed of composite sorbent pellets accounting for radial effects such as increased bed void fraction near the sorption chamber walls. Special focus is laid on the modelling of the sorption equilibria and kinetics of CaCl2/zeolite Ca-X composites of various salt loadings. The developed sorption equilibrium model for arbitrary salt loadings of the CaCl2/zeolite Ca-X is based on isotherm measurements of only one composite sample and one sample of pure zeolite Ca-X thereby enabling reduced experimental effort for the equilibrium characterization. The linear driving force kinetics is calibrated using data from dynamic sorption experiments on zeolite Ca-X and used to predict the dynamic sorption behaviour of CaCl2/zeolite Ca-X composites. We found a good predictive capability of the unmodified kinetics model for high inlet humidities—i.e., the practically most relevant cases where the composite plays its strengths. Contrarily, for low inlet humidities, the used kinetics model strongly overestimates the sorption rate, which indicates the presence of additional kinetic inhibition mechanisms under such conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Dubinin-Polanyi theory; OpenGeoSys; Salt/zeolite composites; Thermochemical energy storage; Water vapour sorption equilibrium; Water vapour sorption kinetics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053721226

Efficiency of any routing protocol is governed by two main factors that is network lifetime and energy conservation.

In this article we first discuss several challenging factors and issues that affects the WSNs routing protocol design. In this paper we categorize various routing protocols in WSNs into three major categories namely the flat networks routing protocols, the hierarchical networks routing protocols and the QoS aware routing protocols. The article explores the flat networks routing protocols as Re-active, Pro-active and Hybrid Protocols and hierarchical networks routing protocols as chain-based, grid-based, tree-based and area-based protocols.

The DFT method was found to yield better agreement with deep inelastic neutron scattering (DINS) measurements than the semi empirical (SE) calculations. The advantage of using the DFT method is to enable us to resolve the external and internal phonon bands of the Cartesian projections of the pVDOS, and hence those of the lattice and vibrational components of Ke(H).

Firstly, a three-point-based electrical model and a method for extracting its five model parameters are developed by using the currents and voltages at the short-, open-circuit and maximum power points provided in usual PV module/panel datasheets. Then, the model and method are validated with the existing six flat-plate PV modules and subsequently are used to predict the hourly electrical performance of the CPV/T roof-top system designed by us under outdoor conditions on four clear days by integrating with a scaling law developed by us.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to predict the stability, sensitivity, energetic performance and mechanical properties of cocrystal models. The binding energy, trigger bond length distribution, interaction energy of trigger bond, cohesive energy density, detonation parameters and mechanical properties were calculated and compared. The influences of adulteration crystal defect on comprehensive properties of CL-20/TNT cocrystal explosive were explored and estimated. The results show that compared with primitive model, binding energies of defective models are decreased by 0.91–14.67%, i.e., the intermolecular interaction energy is decreased and stability is weakened. The maximum trigger bond length is increased by 0.33–4.36%, while the interaction energy of trigger bond is decreased by 1.33–12.27% and cohesive energy density is decreased by 0.45–11.24%, indicating that sensitivity is increased and safety is decreased. The density, detonation velocity and detonation pressure of defective models are decreased by 0.11–7.75%, 0.13–6.47%, 0.32–16.41%, respectively, illustrating that the power and energy density are decreased. Owing to the influence of crystal defect, tensile modulus is decreased by 0.128–5.683 GPa, bulk modulus is decreased by 0.109–3.409 GPa and shear modulus is decreased by 0.048–2.325 GPa, while Cauchy pressure is increased by 0.031–1.112 GPa, meaning that the rigidity, hardness and rupture strength are decreased, ductility is improved.

Where, this consequently results in reduction of the total electricity cost, maximization of power grid sustainability and reduction in carbon dioxide emissions which ultimately results in a pollution free environment. Nowadays, most of the DSM strategies available in existing literature concentrate on house hold appliances scheduling to decrease consumer delay time and peak to average ratio (PAR).

The basic position of the model is that any mechanism of energy transfer between ions can be represented as a sequence of elementary processes. The duration of each elementary process of energy transfer is a random variable. An analytical expression is found for the time dependence of the radiant flux spectral density of ions for any pump modulation and its special case when the durations of elementary processes have exponential distribution laws and the excitation modulation is a rectangular or short pulse. It is shown that the initial stage of this dependence is a power function. The process of energy transfer from the pump radiation to the emitting ion consists of a number of elementary successive stages which determine the exponent. Mechanisms of up-conversion energy transfer under pulsed excitation are considered in systems consisting of ions of two types: donors interacting with pump radiation and acceptors receiving energy from donors. The number of successive elementary processes, of which these mechanisms are composed, is determined. A regression analysis of the rise kinetics of up-conversion luminescence of the Y0.8Yb0.2F3: Tm3+(1 at%) crystal is made using the proposed probabilistic model.

In this paper a stochastic model for coordinated scheduling of renewable and thermal units is proposed. Understudied units consists of fuel cell units with proton exchange membrane which generate heat and power simultaneously (PEMFC-CHP), wind and photovoltaic units. Moreover, the strategy of storing hydrogen is also considered for PEMFC-CHP units. Uncertainties of wind speed, solar radiation and market prices are considered using scenario based method. In the proposed stochastic programming problem, the strategy of storing hydrogen is considered by a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP) problem. The uncertainties of parameters convert the MINP problem to a stochastic MINP one. Moreover, optimal coordinated scheduling of renewable energy resources and thermal units in micro-grids improve the value of the objective function. To solve this problem, Modified Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (MTLBO) algorithm is used and its performance is evaluated on a modified 33 bus distribution network.

It is the major contributor to overall global burden of disease. Any deterioration in brain functioning is reflected in Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals are highly complex, nonstationary and nonlinear. So, it is very difficult to analyze visually and identify changes in the waveform in order to classify MDD and normal subjects. Thus, computerized quantitative EEG is used for the analysis of signals. Support Vector Machine (SVM) using band power feature reported an accuracy of 98.33% and using Kernel Eigen-Filter-Bank Common Spatial Patterns (KEFB-CSP) gave an accuracy of 91.67% [1, 2]. Logistic Regression (LR) using band power feature reported an accuracy of 98.33%, using 4 nonlinear features combination provided an accuracy of 90%, using wavelet transform provided an accuracy of 87.5% and using only alpha power gave an accuracy of 73.3% [1, 3, 4]. Naïve Bayesian (NB) using band power feature provided an accuracy of 96.8% [1]. Artificial Neural Network using Relative Wavelet Energy (RWE) reported an accuracy of 98.11%, using power spectrum feature gave accuracy of 84% and using Lep–Ziv complexity accuracy of 60–80% was reported [5, 6, 7]. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) reported an accuracy of 91.2% using SASI (Spectral Asymmetry Index) and DFA (Detrended Fluctuation Analysis) [8]. Decision Tree provided an accuracy of 80% using EEG band power as feature [9]. The study reveals that, in general, high classification accuracy is achieved by SVM, LR and ANN and highest classification accuracy of 98.33% is achieved by SVM. Highest accuracy is achieved by SVM because it is more robust and computationally more efficient due to maximal margin gap between separating hyper planes and kernel trick. The study gives some ideas which could be helpful for guiding and improving future researches. Since linear and nonlinear method for feature extraction are both equally efficient. So any of the linear/nonlinear feature can be used. For feature selection and reduction, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) can be used. Since SVM, LR and ANN give high classification accuracy and any of them can be used or any hybrid technique like GA-SVM, GA-ANN can be used. This chapter compares various EEG signal analysis techniques, compares their accuracy and methodology used and finally recommends the most suitable technique based on the accuracy for detection of depression. The chapter also summarizes some of the key finding related to EEG features based on present state of art.

In contrast, conventional probabilistic EV charging coordination takes into account the uncertainties of EV and grid loads and PV output without considering their mutual correlations. The major drawbacks of these methods are that the conventional deterministic charging increases the probability of voltage and current noncompliance (PVCN), while the conventional probabilistic charging decreases the quality of service (QoS). Therefore, this paper proposes a novel correlated probabilistic model for EV charging loads in coordination with a solar photovoltaic (PV)-rich commercial grid. In this model, correlated samples are generated from uncorrelated samples, which contain various random variables associated with EVs, battery energy storage (BES) and PV. The generated samples are subsequently incorporated in the proposed coordinated EV charging method, where the power factors of BES and PV are also controlled, to maximize QoS while minimizing PVCN.

The performance of a SWC system is closely related to the hydrogeological and thermogeological properties. Also, the proper system design and installation are crucial to maintain long-term sustainability and efficiency. In this work, a series of scenarios were simulated to evaluate the influence of different parameters on the outlet temperature evolution and efficiency of a SWC system.

One of the important activities in this respect is to model, build and operate a 100% renewable electricity grid on the World (Globalgrid). This target isn’t so easy to be achieved without a very well organized and planned system. One of the major renewable energy source in the Globalgrid will be the solar energy. The very large photovoltaic power plants will most probably play a critical role. This paper presents an experimental fuzzy weighted average aggregated location selection model for the very large photovoltaic power plants in the Globalgrid Concept in the very early engineering design process stages to help the modeling, designing, constructing and operating efforts of the Globalgrid. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Climate change; Concept; Design; Earth; Electricity; Energy; Engineering; Engineering design process; FuzzME; Fuzzy expert system; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy Models of Multiple-Criteria Evaluation; Fuzzy weighted average; Globalgrid; Globalgrid concept; Multiple-criteria fuzzy evaluation; Photovoltaic power plants; Photovoltaics; Solar power; Very large photovoltaic power plants",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054401677

There are several ways in the research and development stages and in the operational stages to convert the sunlight into the electricity, such as using the concentrated photovoltaics (CPV). When the electricity generation technology differs, requirements, requisites, and obligations differ very much. Nowadays, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region has some unique properties, especially regarding the actual conditions and situations of the social conflicts, violence, chaos, disputes and wars. Under these conditions, some of the factors loss their importance and meaning, so that they become absurd, worthless and useless. This paper presents an experimental ordered fuzzy weighted average (fuzzy OWA: FOWA) aggregated location selection model for the very large concentrated photovoltaic power plants (VLCPVPPs) in the MENA Region in the very early engineering design process stages. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Concentrated photovoltaic power; CPV; Design; Electricity; Energy; Engineering; Engineering design process; FOWA; FuzzME; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy models of multiple-criteria evaluation; Fuzzy ordered weighted average operator; Fuzzy OWA; MENA; Middle east and north Africa; Multiple-criteria fuzzy evaluation; North Africa; Power; Solar; Solar power; Very large concentrated photovoltaic power plants",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054350652
